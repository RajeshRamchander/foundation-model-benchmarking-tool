The film was directed by Bud Pollard.\\n\\nThemes\\nThe Black King chronicles the rise and fall of a fictionalized charismatic leader of a back-to-Africa movement, satirizing the life of Marcus Garvey. The film explores numerous critiques of Garvey's movement, including the lack of knowledge about Africa, the presumptuousness in making plans for future development and government in Africa without consultation of people already there, and conflicts between lighter skinned and darker skinned African Americans. While Garvey was a primarily a political leader with religious opinions, his counterpart in the film was primarily a preacher and religious leader. The film was intended to resonate with the audience's pre-existing disillusionment with Garvey.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe Black King was written as a stage play by Donald Heywood and plans were publicly announced to produce it on Broadway directed by Russian choreographer L\\u00e9onide Massine. This never took place. Instead, Heywood's story was adapted by Morris M. Levinson and it was produced as a film by Southland Pictures under white director Bud Pollard in 1932.

He is the god who planted the tree of life called Ulukay\\u0131n. Kayra is described as both father and mother, and resides in the 17th layer of heaven.He is the supreme god of the pantheon and the son of sky deity named Tengri. This son, Kara Han (the black king or ruler of the land \\u2013 Kara may mean land, earth, black or in a sense strong, powerful), left his father's home in the heaven and went to live in the underworld. On occasion, identified as Kara-Khan (black king), he was the primordial god and his father was the ancordial god called Tengri.\\n\\nEtymology\\nThe name of this deity is found in several forms, as is that of his opponent. \\\"Kayra-Khan\\\" may be translated as \\\"merciful king\\\", while the form \\\"Kara Han\\\" signifies \\\"black king\\\". For this reason, authority on Turkic Mythology Deniz Karakurt, considers Kara-Han and Kayra-Han to be two different deities. Furthermore, the Turkish word kara can mean both black and land, with the result that Kara Han can mean not only 'Black (Dark) Ruler' but also 'Ruler of the Land'.\\n\\nGod of Creation\\nIn ancient Turkic  belief known as Altai myth of creation, Tangri (God) Kara Han is neither male nor female nor even human in form, but a pure-white goose that flies constantly over an endless expanse of water (time), the benign creator of all that is, including the other, lesser gods. Among all Altai people the dualistic division is most clear (Ulgen and Erlik), and the highest god, Tengre Kaira Khan, is a good power. But before Ak Ana appears to urge it to create, Kara-han becomes anxious, creation occurring in a context of loneliness, turmoil and fear: the water becomes turbulent, but it reassures itself that it \\\"need not fear\\\" (the implication of such self-reassurance being that it is indeed afraid). Supreme being in the universe it created, Kara-han is the ruler of the three realms of air, water and land, seated on the seventeenth level of the universe, from which it determines the fate of its creation. After creating the universe it planted the nine-boughed tree of life, from the branches of which came the ancestors of humans. Thus emerged the nine races (nine clans).\\nIt has three sons: Ulgan, Mergen and Kyzaghan.\\nA Tuvinian / Soyoth legend, told as follows: The giant turtle which supported the earth moved, which caused the cosmic ocean to begin flooding the earth. An old man who had guessed something like this would happen, built a raft. Boarded it with his family, and he was saved. When the waters receded, the raft was left on a high wooded mountain, where, it is said, it remains today. After the flood Kaira-Khan created everything around the world. Among other things, he taught people how to make Araq (some kind of liquor).\\n\\nSee also\\nBai-Ulgan\\nTurul\\nPassage 6:\\nBlack King\\nBlack King may refer to:\\n\\nThe black king (chess)\\nA black king (playing card), either the King of Spades or the King of Clubs\\nBlack King (comics), a number of comics characters\\nBlack King, a character in Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror\\nBlack King (Ultra monster), a kaiju from Return of Ultraman\\nLampropeltis getula, the Black King Snake\\nThe Black King (film), a 1932 race film starring A.B.
