W. Botha, declared his maternity ward extraterritorial land, to ensure that Leka was born on Albanian soil. Leka is the only child of Leka, Crown Prince of Albania and his wife Susan, Crown Princess of Albania.

Msiziwe is a Zulu term meaning \'the one who was assisted\'. Leka is a member of the House of Zogu.\n\nEducation and activities\nLeka\'s was educated in South Africa at St Peter\'s College, Johannesburg, and in the United Kingdom at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, where he was named Best Foreign Student of the Academy, being congratulated by the Albanian Minister of Defence.

She is also head of the Queen Geraldine Foundation, which is a humanitarian, charitable and non-profit organisation, created by the Royal Court. The foundation aims to be close to the Albanian families who need help and to children who need care. It has reconstructed numerous schools and kindergartens in northern Albania, especially in the Mat District, from where the Zogu Family comes.\nOn 27 March 2016 it was announced by Skënder Zogu (born 1933), a member of the Zogu family, that the couple would be married on 8 October 2016 in the Royal Palace in Tirana.\n\nWedding\nLeka was married on Saturday 8 October 2016 in Tirana. The ceremony was a semi-official ceremony, held in Tirana in the Royal Palace, with many guests including members of other noble and royal families.

Meanwhile, Albania itself was a communist republic.\n\nEarly life\nSusan Cullen-Ward was born in the Sydney suburb of Waverley. Her mother was Phyllis Dorothea Murray-Prior and her father was Alan Robert Cullen-Ward, a pastoralist. Susan Cullen-Ward was a great-granddaughter of the Queensland politician Thomas Lodge Murray-Prior (1819–1892).\nCullen-Ward grew up on her father\'s sheep station. She attended Presbyterian Ladies\' College at Orange, then studied at Sydney Technical College before teaching art at a private studio.She was married to Richard Williams from 1965 to 1970. Susan Cullen-Ward was an Anglican.\n\nMarriage to the Crown Prince of Albania\nSusan Cullen-Ward met Leka, Crown Prince of Albania, the only child of King Zog I of the Albanians, at a dinner party in Sydney. In October 1975, they married in a civil ceremony in Biarritz, France. The couple were later married in a religious ceremony in Madrid.\nAustralian authorities refused to recognise her as a queen but, in a compromise when Andrew Peacock was foreign minister, issued a passport in the name of ""Susan Cullen-Ward, known as Queen Susan"".She lived a turbulent life after marrying Leka, as they moved from one country to another, having no permanent residence or fixed point of reference. In the first few years of their marriage, the couple lived in Spain. They later settled in Rhodesia (now known as Zimbabwe). After a falling out with the government of Robert Mugabe, the couple moved again, this time to South Africa where their son, Leka, was born in 1982. She also had a stillborn daughter while resident in Rhodesia.\n\nDeath\nThe Crown Princess of Albania died of lung cancer on 17 July 2004 in Tirana, Albania.

Band-e-Amir is a chain of six lakes in the mountainous desert of central Afghanistan. The lakes formed from mineral-rich water that seeped out of faults and cracks in the rocky landscape. Over time, the water deposited layers of hardened mineral (travertine) that built up into walls that now contain the water. According to the Wildlife Conservation Society, who helped the Afghan government set up the park, Band-e-Amir is one of the few travertine systems in the world.They were created by the carbon dioxide rich water oozing out of the faults and fractures to deposit calcium carbonate precipitate in the form of travertine walls that today store the water of these lakes. Band-e Amir is one of the few rare natural lakes in the world which are created by travertine systems. The site of Band-e Amir has been described as Afghanistan\'s Grand Canyon, and draws thousands of tourists a year. The river is part of the system of the Balkh River.\n\nHistory\nThe name Band-e Amir literally means ""the Ruler\'s Dam"" which is believed by some to be a reference to Ali, the fourth Caliph of the Muslims. The area is dominated by ethnic Hazaras, who are estimated to make up about 40 percent of Afghanistan\'s population.In her 1970 guide to Afghanistan, Nancy Dupree wrote that a full description about Band-e Amir would ""rob the uninitiated of the wonder and amazement it produces on all who gaze upon it"". Parts of the 1975 Bollywood film Dharmatma, with Feroz Khan and Hema Malini, were filmed at the Band-e Amir National Park.In 2004, Band-e Amir was submitted for recognition as a World Heritage site. Efforts to make Band-e Amir a national park started in the 1970s, but were then put on hold due to the wars. In April 2009, Band-e Amir was finally declared Afghanistan\'s first national park. As of 2013, about 6,000 local tourists visit the Band-e Amir National Park every year. The area is protected by a small number of park rangers.\n\nGeography\nBand-e Amir is situated at approximately 75 km to the north-west of the ancient city of Bamyan, close to the town of Yakawlang. Together with Bamyan Valley, they are the heart of Afghanistan\'s tourism, attracting thousands of tourists every year and from every corner of the world. The Band-e Amir lakes are primarily a late spring and summertime tourism destination, as the high elevation central Hazarajat region of Afghanistan is extremely cold in winter, with temperatures reaching as low as −20 °C (−4.0 °F). The six constituent lakes of Band-e Amir are:\n\nBand-e Gholaman (Lake of the slaves)\nBand-e Qambar (Lake of Caliph Ali\'s slave)\nBand-e Haibat (Lake of grandiose)\nBand-e Panir (Lake of cheese)\nBand-e Pudina (Lake of wild mint)\nBand-e Zulfiqar (Lake of the sword of Ali)The white travertine dams created by fault lines, which are prevalent in the Band-e Amir Valley, form the barriers between the lakes. Band-e Haibat is the biggest and the deepest of the six, with an average depth of approximately 150 metres, as estimated by the Provincial Reconstruction Team diving team from New Zealand. Another comparable lake is Band-e Azhdahar (The Dragon), located a few kilometres southeast of the town of Bamyan, which has also been created as a result of carbon dioxide rich water oozing out of the faults underground and depositing calcium carbonate precipitate to form the travertine walls of Band-e Amir.\n\nClimate\nHigh in the Hindu Kush at approximately 2,900 metres (9,500 ft) above sea level, the national park has a subarctic climate (Dsc) closely bordering on a warm-summer humid continental climate (Dsb). The climate is extremely severe and the lakes freezing over in winter.\n\nCurrent status\nAfter the formal establishment of the park in 2009, a park office with a park warden and a group of rangers was installed to manage the conservation and protection of park natural resources. Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) is the only non-government organization with an office in the park. WCS supports park staff and works with the local community to promote conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. Ecotourism is expected to decrease local economic dependency on the park\'s natural resources. Tourists visit Band-e-Amir primarily in the summer months when the weather is warm. A poor local economy and limited outside investment have hampered efforts to attract winter tourism.\nThe local people in Band-e-Amir National Park rely heavily on the park\'s natural resources for their livelihood. Grazing of livestock, collection of shrubs for fuel and winter fodder and rain-fed farming is still widely practiced within the park boundary. Although the illegal hunting of birds and a few mammals living in the park is formally prohibited by the park office, there is no current data to evaluate the status of wildlife and biodiversity.\n\nImportant Bird Area\nA 41,000 ha tract overlapping the national park has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of Himalayan snowcocks, Hume\'s larks, white-winged snowfinches, Afghan snowfinches and Eurasian crimson-winged finches.\n\nSee also\nList of dams and reservoirs in Afghanistan\nNatural areas of Afghanistan\nWakhan National Park\nNuristan National Park\nPassage 2:\nQasim Oryakhail\nQasim Oryakhail (born 10 January 1992) is an Afghan cricketer.

The Legislature would convene in the Benicia City Hall for a little more than a year, when again complaints over poor weather conditions, inadequate and uncomfortable sleeping quarters, and ""the insecure condition of the public archives"" arose in January 1854.\nAfter a proposal by Sacramento to use the Sacramento County Courthouse free of charge as a capital building, the Assembly and Senate passed an enabling act, voiding all previous legislation, to move the state capital to its new location upriver in Sacramento. On February 25, 1854, Governor Bigler signed the act into law, moving the capital to its current location. The Legislature and governor climbed aboard the steamship Wilson G. Hunt to take up its new quarters. ""So much opposed to the removal were the good people of Benicia,"" the Sacramento Union reported, ""that the owners of the wharves, it is stated, refused to permit the steamer ... to land to take on the legislative furniture, unless she would pay $500."" This request was refused and the furniture was shipped from a different wharf.The Greek Revival-Palladian building was listed as a California State Historic Landmark on January 11, 1935.

It also was placed on the Governor\'s list of two hundred parks to close in fall of 2009 in response to the ongoing budget crisis and was on Jerry Brown\'s 2011 list of 70 proposed state park closures in the continuing budget crises.In March 2013, then-Director of California Department of Parks and Recreation, Anthony L.

The village center grew nearby his house, and now includes a village green, church, and a number of 18th and 19th century houses.  The village declined in economic importance in the late 19th century, as it was supplanted by other villages in the town better sited for industrial activity.The historic district is centered on the junction of Route 57 with Southfield Road, and extends onto Monterey and New Marlborough Branch Roads.  The village green is located north of the junction, with the 1839 Congregational church and the historic tavern on the north side.  The district also includes some industrial remains, including those of an 1830s foundry, one of the few instances of industrial activity in the village.  Several of the houses are fine examples of Greek Revival architecture.  The town\'s first cemetery is located at the western end of the village, and just to the north of the church are the foundational remains of a short-lived academy, which operated from 1855 to 1885.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Berkshire County, Massachusetts\nPassage 9:\nNorth Boone Community Unit School District 200\nNorth Boone Community Unit School District 200 is a unified school district based in the central region of the county of its namesake, Boone County; more specifically, in the village of Poplar Grove, Illinois.

Thompson, the retired editor of Life magazine, was asked by the then-Secretary of the Smithsonian, S. Dillon Ripley, to produce a magazine ""about things in which the Smithsonian [Institution] is interested, might be interested or ought to be interested.""Thompson would later recall that his philosophy for the new magazine was that it ""would stir curiosity in already receptive minds. It would deal with history as it is relevant to the present. It would present art, since true art is never dated, in the richest possible reproduction. It would peer into the future via coverage of social progress and of science and technology. Technical matters would be digested and made intelligible by skilled writers who would stimulate readers to reach upward while not turning them off with jargon. We would find the best writers and the best photographers—not unlike the best of the old Life.""In 1973, the magazine turned a profit for the first time. By 1974, circulation had nearly quadrupled, to 635,000, and it reached the one million milestone in 1975—one of the most successful launches of its time.

Subsequent revisions of the book were published in 1986, 1989, 2000, and 2008.\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe first few chapters following the brief introduction about Bundy\'s birth and family describe Rule\'s friendship with Bundy, her first impressions of him, and her reluctance to consider the evidence that he might be responsible for the crimes of which he was accused.\n\nThe events of the Chi Omega murders at Florida State University in January 1978 are written in third person, but not omnisciently, as the perpetrator is not identified as being Bundy, thus keeping the documentation of these events in-sync with the knowledge available to officers at the time.\n\nIt is not until Bundy\'s capture and trials in Florida that Rule fully accepts that Bundy is a serial killer. She finds the idea shocking to the point that she ""[runs] to the ladies room and throws up.""  An afterword, following Rule\'s lament for Bundy and his victims, describes the Kimberly Leach trial. The 1989 update outlines Bundy\'s execution, and the 2000 update touches on many things, including various women claiming to have encountered Bundy in the 1970s, Robert Keppel\'s retirement from detective work and his employment at the University of Washington, and Bundy\'s possible involvement in the unsolved disappearance of Ann Marie Burr, a girl who disappeared in 1961 when Bundy was 14. \n\nA 2008 update of the book includes more stories from women who have contacted Rule with stories of their ""near-miss"" contacts with a man they believe was Ted Bundy, and also a ""Ted Bundy FAQ"" section in which Rule tries to answer the questions most frequently asked by readers, including the fact that he was not responsible for the 1973 murder of Kathy Merry Devine, for which he was long suspected. DNA testing linked that killing to an ex-convict named William Cosden, who was subsequently tried and convicted of her murder.\n\nFilm adaptation\n\nIn 2003, The Stranger Beside Me was adapted into a made-for-TV film, starring Billy Campbell as Bundy and Barbara Hershey as Rule.\nQuestion:\nAnn Rules book The Stranger Beside Me, is about what serial killer, assumed to have murdered 35 people, before hitting the electric chair in Starke, Florida on January 24, 1989?\nAnswer:\nMelissa Smith (murder victim)\nPassage:\nGulf of Bothnia\nThe Gulf of Bothnia (; ) is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It is situated between Finland\'s west coast and Sweden\'s east coast. In the south of the gulf lie the Åland Islands, between the Sea of Åland and the Archipelago Sea.\n\nName\n\nBothnia is a latinization. The Swedish name ""Bottenviken"" was originally just ""Botn(en)"" with botn being Old Norse for ""gulf"" or ""bay"";  which is also the meaning of the second element ""vik"".\n\nThe name botn was applied to the Gulf of Bothnia as Helsingjabotn in Old Norse, after Hälsingland, which at the time referred to the coastland west of the gulf. Later, botten was applied to the regions Västerbotten on the western side and Österbotten the eastern side (""East Bottom"" and ""West Bottom""). The Finnish name of Österbotten, Pohjanmaa, or ""Pohja""-land, gives a hint as to the meaning in both languages: pohja means both ""bottom"" and ""north.""\n\nBotn/botten is cognate with the English word bottom, and it might be part of a general north European distinction of lowlands, as opposed to highlands, such as the Netherlandic region, Samogitia (Lithuanian), and Sambia (Russia).\n\nA second possibility is that botten follows an alternative Scandinavian connotation of \'furthermost\'. Thus, the Gulf of Bothnia would be the farthest extent of the Ocean.\n\nJulius Pokorny gives the extended Indo-European root as *bhudh-m(e)n with a *bhudh-no- variant, from which the Latin fundus, as in fundament, is derived. The original meaning of English north, from Indo-European *ner- ""under"", indicates an original sense of ""lowlands"" for ""bottomlands"". On the other hand, by ""north"" the classical authors usually meant ""outermost"", as the northern lands were outermost to them.\n\nThe origin of the word is indeed very ancient, belonging to a period before the world discoveries by the Portuguese. Until then, North was not seen as the magnetic top of the world, East being the normal orientation of a map. \n\nAlso, in Saami, the cardinal directions were named according to the different parts of the typical tent used by this nomadic people. The door of the tent was traditionally pointed South, in the most sunny direction, and the bottom of the tent would be aligned with the North. Thus the origin of the word \'Pohja\' in its use as ""North"". Deriving as well from this logic is the affinity in the Finnish language of the words \'eteinen\', meaning ""entrance room/hall"" and \'Etelä\', ""South"".\n\nGeography\n\nExtent\n\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the southern limit of the Gulf of Bothnia as follows: \n\nFrom Simpnäsklubb (59°54\'N) in Sweden, to Flötjan, Lagskær [sic], Fæstörne [sic], Kökarsörn, and Vænö-Kalkskær [sic] to the SW point of Hangöudde (Hangö Head, 59°49\'N) in Finland, thus including the Aland islands and adjacent shoals and channels in the Gulf of Bothnia.\n\nGeophysical data\n\nThe gulf is 725\xa0km (450\xa0mi) long, 80–240\xa0km (50-150\xa0mi) wide and has an average depth of 60 m (200\xa0ft, 33 fathoms). The maximum depth is 295 m (965\xa0ft, 161 fathoms). The surface area is 117,000\xa0km² (45,200 sq mi). The northernmost point is situated in Töre in the Bothnian Bay. its coordinates are 65° 54\'07"" N 22° 39\'00 E. \n\nThe depth and surface area of Gulf if Bothnia are constantly decreasing, as the land is rising after it had been pressed down by the continental ice during last ice age.  The rise is 80 cm every hundred years. \n\nInto the gulf flow a number of rivers from both sides; consequently, a salinity gradient exists from north to south.\nIn the south the water is the normal brackish water of the Baltic Sea, but in the north, in the Bothnian Bay, the salinity is so low,  from 0.4% near Kvarken to 0.2% in the northernmost part,  and many freshwater fish such as the pike, whitefish and perch thrive in it.\n\nBeing nearly fresh, the gulf is frozen over five months every year. The icing of the Baltic Sea begins and ends in the northern Gulf of Bothnia. Traffic restrictions for ice breaker assistance are typically in force for all the gulf from late January to late April and for the northernmost ports from the middle of December to the middle of May. \n\nGeological history\n\nFor the geological history of the entire region, refer to the Baltic Sea.\n\nHistory\n\nSome historians suggest that the adventurer Ottar was referring to the Gulf of Bothnia when he spoke of the Kven Sea in the 9th century. It is also possible that Claudius Clavus\'s usage of the term Mare Gotticus in the 15th century refers to the Gulf of Bothnia.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe land surrounding the Gulf of Bothnia is heavily forested. Trees are logged, then transported to the coast for milling. The gulf is also important for oil transport to the coastal cities and ore transport to steel mills, for instance in Raahe.\n\nIn terms of  tonnage in international traffic,  the largest ports on the Finnish side are Rauma, Kokkola and Tornio. The main ports of the Swedish side are in Luleå, Skellefteå, Umeå, Sundsvall, Gävle and Hargshamn. In Luleå, iron ore pellets are exported and coal is imported. Gävle is Sweden\'s third-largest container port. It also ships forest products and oil.  The Gulf of Bothnia, ice breakers assist the ports needed in average half a year, when the Gulf of Finland, the season is only three months. \n\nThere is some fishery, mainly Baltic herring, for domestic needs. A persistent problem has been pollution, because the sea is enclosed by a large drainage basin and is poorly connected to fresher waters from the Atlantic. Mercury and PCB levels have been relatively high, although the Finnish Food Safety Authority considers the herring edible. Although the levels exceed the limits, the fatty acids have health benefits that offset this risk.\n\nRivers\n\n*Kemijoki\n*Kokemäenjoki\n*Oulujoki\n*Dalälven\n*Ljusnan\n*Ljungan\n*Indalsälven\n*Ångerman River\n*Ume River\n*Skellefte River\n*Pite River\n*Lule River\n*Kalix River\n*Torne River\n\nCities\n\n*Oulu\n*Pori\n*Rauma\n*Vaasa\n*Luleå\n*Umeå\n*Härnösand\n*Sundsvall\n*Gävle\n*Jakobstad\nQuestion:\nWhere is the Gulf of Bothnia?\nAnswer:\nMare Suevicum\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nDeath to Spies\nReleased in 2007, Death to Spies () is a stealth third-person shooter PC game set in World War II and produced by 1C Company and Haggard Games. The game was released on Valve\'s digital distribution system, Steam, on March 12, 2008.\n\nGameplay\n\nDeath to Spies takes place from a third-person perspective. The player controls Semion Strogov, a captain in a Soviet counterintelligence agency named SMERSH. Strogov is able to run, jump, crouch, crawl and climb over obstacles, and he is also able to drive vehicles. Taking place in World War II, the player is required to complete various tasks in enemy territory, such as killing targets and stealing documents. Emphasis is placed on stealth, as the player is greatly outnumbered by enemy personnel, and some missions will be failed if the alarm is raised. \n\nThe game\'s missions are connected by cutscenes, taking place in 1951. After the arrest of the head of SMERSH Viktor Abakumov, Semion Strogov is questioned about his involvement in a number of special operations between 1943 through 1946, as his interrogators search for any connections between him and Abakumov.\n\nThe Heads-up display shows the level of awareness and suspicion of enemies, both of which are represented with a single bar at the top of the screen and are represented separately as different icons. A vector map can be displayed on the screen, showing characters\' locations and their fields of vision, in which the player will be detected either instantly or gradually, depending on the distance. The vector map also shows the radius of noises made by the player; if someone is within the radius of the noise, they may investigate the noise or become alerted, depending on the noise.\n\nDisguises can be used to avoid alerting enemies when seen. When a character is knocked unconscious or killed without damaging the uniform, Strogov can change into their clothes. Some enemies are able to see through disguises and can be alerted if the player enters their vision, and all enemies can be alerted to suspicious behaviour which includes picking the lock of a door or looking through a door\'s keyhole, being in certain stances or having certain weapons visible.\n\nBefore starting a mission, the player is usually able to select equipment to bring to the mission. Strogov has a carrying capacity limited to one handgun, one long gun and 18 slots for small items such as ammunition and knives; one knife can also be stored in a dedicated slot. A backpack has space for larger items such as pliers and dynamite, and space for small items, but Strogov also has a weight limit to his inventory, and small items stored in a backpack must be moved to the 18 slots before it can be used.\nA variety of firearms (along with ammunition) and explosives are available to choose from, with the choices available depending on the mission. Other weapons include chloroform, knives, a garrote and poison. German equipment can also be chosen to avoid suspicion from enemy personnel when in disguise and/or to make use of ammunition taken from enemies\' bodies.\n\nSeveral missions take place in allied areas. The player is forced to begin these missions lightly armed and they cannot select their equipment. However, weapons and ammunition can be found in the level.\n\nReception\n\nDeath to Spies mostly received above average reviews. The game has an average score of 70% on Game Rankings  and 69% on Metacritic.  GameSpot gave it a 7.0, praising its detailed level design variation and challenging missions, but at the same time noting that the game can be overly difficult at times. IGN gave it an 8.0, saying it was ""horrifically difficult at times and not without its peculiarities; Death to Spies is nevertheless always interesting and wholly addictive."" \n\nSequel\n\nOn March 23, 2009 1C Company announced a sequel, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth.

Furthermore, it can be characterized as one of the few Mediterranean winds that do not necessarily die out at the end of the day and can easily last more than three to six days. See my climate page for Greek weather statistics.\nThe onset is the monsoonal\neffect of the summer season that leads to the development of an   intense heat trough over southern Asia extending westward over the Anatolian plateau. Higher pressure dominates over the relatively cooler surface of the   Mediterranean Sea, and settled, dry weather persists.    Northerly winds prevail along the Greek coast during the   winter also, but only those northerly winds occurring between May and   November are considered Etesian. The pressure gradients necessary to drive the   Meltemi result from a combination of:\nThe monsoonal effect during the summer that leads to a low pressure      trough over Turkey. Etesian winds flow from a high pressure ridge over     the Balkans toward the trough. During a strong Etesian, the trough may     extend relatively far to the west and beyond Rhodes . It may also form     a closed low, resulting in almost calm winds at Rhodes.\nSynoptic conditions leading to anti-cyclogenesis\nover the Balkans.\nA jet-effect increase of wind caused by channelling of the wind between      islands and mountain valleys. These effects tend to render wind reports     from certain locations unrepresentative. In the lee of Crete, katabatic     flow off the mountains generates gusty winds similar to the Föhn\nof the     Alps. The mountain valleys tend to channel the flow which increases the     wind velocity.\nThe surface flow is generally divergent in an Etesian situation, and    the weather is generally thought to be dry with clear skies. However,    this is mostly true only during the main yacht charter season of July and August    when scattered altocumulus appear a day before an Etesian, and the only other clouds are orographic\ntypes that may form on the lee    side of islands in stronger Etesian winds.\nThe Meltemi occurs mainly during the summer season (June - September with 70%), but also in May and October one may frequently experience this dry wind.\nOne should anticipate its maximum during July and August.\nUsually the wind starts in the early afternoon reaching 4-5 Beaufort\nand dies out at sun set. However, not uncommonly it reaches 5-7 Bft during the day, perseveres during the night and blows 5-7 Bft again the next day; a pattern which can easily be repeated over many days, sometimes even up to ten days.\nIf during this period sailing to windward cannot be avoided, it can be very wise to lift anchor at dawn and to cover as many miles as possible before the wind starts\n.\n\xa0\nImportant guidelines\nDue to the katabatic nature of the meltemi one can experience strong fall winds on the leeward side of the islands, notorious are Kea (we did survive though), Evvia, Tinos and Andros , Folegandros , Kos , Serifos , Amorgos and Sifnos . An orographic cloud to leeward of the mountain spells danger.\nWhen the wind encounters very high cliffs on the North shore of an island, a calm - extending several miles off shore - can be expected. Good examples are Amorgos, Paros and Naxos .\nIn the wide corridor between de dodecanese and cycladic islands the Meltemi blows undisturbed over 100 miles. Within six hours of a 30-knot wind, the waves can reach heights over three meters. The adverse currents make these waves steeper, which can be seriously dangerous for yachts smaller than 10 meter.\nThe Ionian Sea in the west of Greece is not affected by these Etesian winds but experiences a reliable Maistro wind throughout the sailing season. For an explanation on the Maistro wind please visit my page on Sailing routes in the Ionian .\nExpect funnelling winds, which can make certain straits dangerous to pass because of currents and higher wind velocities. Classical areas are: between Andros and Evvia (currents up to 5 knots!); between Ikaria and Samos till the Fournoi-archipelago; Between Paros and Naxos; North side of Amorgos; West side of Karpathos. Sometimes South of both Kea and Kythnos .\nTell-tales for your own Meltemi 24-36 hour prediction:\nHigher predicted atmospheric pressure over the Balkan/Northern Aegean.\nA sudden drop in humidity (first morning without dew on deck).\nScattered little altocumulus clouds one day in advance.\nA clear improvement of visibility combined with a raise in atmospheric pressure (4 hPa within 12 hours).\nFortunately, the possibility of stronger winds is actually the only shortcoming of the Aegean. There are hardly any shallow waters, no tides to speak off and no fog (good visibility!): all the ingredients for perfect yacht charter vacations .\nRelated pages:\nQuestion:\nWhat type of weather condition is a Meltemi?\nAnswer:\nBlustery\nPassage:\nRump (animal)\nThe rump or croup, in the external morphology of an animal, is the portion of the posterior dorsum that is posterior to the loins and anterior to the tail.  Anatomically, the rump corresponds to the sacrum.  \n\nThe tailhead or dock is the beginning of the tail, where the tail joins the rump.  It is known also as the base or root of the tail, and corresponds to the human sacrococcygeal symphysis.  In some mammals the tail may be said to consist of the tailbone (meaning the bony column, muscles, and skin) and the skirt (meaning the long hairs growing from the tailbone).  In birds, similarly, the tail consists of tailbone and tailfan (tail fan).\n\nSome animals are subjected to docking, the amputation of the tailbone at or near the dock.  These include dogs, cats, sheep, pigs, and horses.  Humans have a remnant tail, the coccyx, and the human equivalent of docking is coccygectomy.\n\nUsage\n\nUsage varies from animal to animal.  Birds and cattle are said to have a rump and tailhead.  Dogs are said to have a rump and dock.  Horses are said to have a croup    (sometimes rump),  thigh or haunch, buttock, and dock.\n\nBirds\n\nIn bird anatomy, the rump is the body immediately above the tail.  The color of plumage on the rump is a characteristic widely used by ornithologists to distinguish between related species, and sometimes also between males and females of the same species. Similarly, the silhouette of the tailfan is a characteristic widely used for purposes of identification, particularly in the field.\n\nSome birds have a food reservoir pouch in the esophagus that is known as a croup.\n\nDogs\n\nIn some breeds it is traditional for tails to be cut off (docked) at the dock.\n\nHorses\n\nIn horse anatomy, the croup refers specifically to the topline of the horse\'s hindquarters and surrounding musculature, beginning at the hip, extending proximate to the sacral vertebrae and stopping at the dock of the tail (where the coccygeal vertebrae begin). Below the croup is the thigh or haunch. Behind the thigh is the buttock.\nOn horses appearing in parades and other public ceremonies, the croup may be decorated with a pattern in the horse\'s hair, formed by applying hair gel or spray, then brushing patches of hair in opposite directions.\n\nApplied to horses, the term ""dock"" has two additional uses. Its meaning may be extended to either the entire tail minus the skirt (i.e., synonymous with tailbone)  or the tailhead only.  In other equidae, it encompasses most of the tailbone, as most of that portion of the tail does not have long hairs.  A lack of long hairs can be natural, as in zebras, donkeys, and the Przewalski horse, or artificial, the result of pulling, trimming, or shaving part of the skirt (see Horse grooming).\n\nA sponge used to wash the hairless skin on the underside of the dock and other regions under the tail, protected by the dock, is called a dock sponge. Thus, the meaning of ""dock"" has been used to refer to the orifices beneath the dock, specifically the anus and vagina, creating a misapprehension that ""dock"" refers to the anus, as in, a horse\'s fundamental orifice is its dock.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the croup of an animal, such as a horse?\nAnswer:\nRump\nPassage:\nDaniel Gabriel Fahrenheit\nDaniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (;; 24 May 1686 – 16 September 1736) was a Polish-born German  physicist, engineer, and glass blower who is best known for inventing the mercury-in-glass thermometer (1714), and for developing a temperature scale now named after him. \n\nBiography \n\nFahrenheit was born in the city of Danzig (Gdańsk), Pomeranian Voivodeship in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, but lived most of his life in the Dutch Republic. The Fahrenheits were a German Hanse merchant family who had lived in several Hanseatic cities. Fahrenheit\'s great-grandfather had lived in Rostock, and research suggests that the Fahrenheit family originated in Hildesheim.  Daniel\'s grandfather moved from Kneiphof in Königsberg (present-day Kaliningrad) to Danzig and settled there as a merchant in 1650. His son, Daniel Fahrenheit (the father of the subject of this article), married Concordia Schumann, daughter of a well-known Danzig business family. Daniel was the eldest of the five Fahrenheit children (two sons, three daughters) who survived childhood. His sister, Virginia Elizabeth Fahrenheit, married Benjamin Ephraim Krueger of an aristocratic family from Danzig. \n\nDaniel Gabriel  began training as a merchant in Amsterdam after his parents died on 14 August 1701 from eating poisonous mushrooms. However, Fahrenheit\'s interest in natural science led him to begin studies and experimentation in that field. From 1717, he traveled to Berlin, Halle, Leipzig, Dresden, Copenhagen, and also to his hometown, where his brother still lived. During that time, Fahrenheit met or was in contact with Ole Rømer, Christian Wolff, and Gottfried Leibniz. In 1717, Fahrenheit settled in The Hague as a glassblower, making barometers, altimeters, and thermometers. From 1718 onwards, he lectured in chemistry in Amsterdam.  He visited England in 1724 and was the same year elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.  Fahrenheit died in The Hague and was buried there at the Kloosterkerk (Cloister Church).\n\nIn 2012, scientists made a computer image of his face using photos of his relatives. \n\nFahrenheit scale \n\nAccording to Fahrenheit\'s 1724 article,  he determined his scale by reference to three fixed points of temperature.  The lowest temperature was achieved by preparing a frigorific mixture of ice, water, and ammonium chloride (a salt), and waiting for it to reach equilibrium.  The thermometer then was placed into the mixture and the liquid in the thermometer allowed to descend to its lowest point.  The thermometer\'s reading there was taken as 0\xa0°F.  The second reference point was selected as the reading of the thermometer when it was placed in still water when ice was just forming on the surface.  This was assigned as 32\xa0°F.  The third calibration point, taken as 96\xa0°F, was selected as the thermometer\'s reading when the instrument was placed under the arm or in the mouth.\n\nFahrenheit came up with the idea that mercury boils around 300 degrees on this temperature scale. Work by others showed that water boils about 180 degrees above its freezing point.  The Fahrenheit scale later was redefined to make the freezing-to-boiling interval exactly 180 degrees, a convenient value as 180 is a highly composite number, meaning that it is evenly divisible into many fractions. It is because of the scale\'s redefinition that normal body temperature today is taken as 98.2 degrees,  whereas it was 96 degrees on Fahrenheit\'s original scale. \n\nThe Fahrenheit scale was the primary temperature standard for climatic, industrial and medical purposes in English-speaking countries until the 1960s.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the first name of Mr. Fahrenheit, after whom the temperature scale was named?\nAnswer:\nGABRIEL\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nGrace Slick w.

The smallest thrush may be the forest rock thrush, at 21 g and . However, the shortwings, which have ambiguous alliances with both thrushes and Old World flycatchers, can be even smaller. The lesser shortwing averages 12 cm. The largest thrush is the blue whistling thrush, at 178 g and 33 cm. The great thrush is similar in length, but less heavily built.  Most species are grey or brown in colour, often with speckled underparts.\n\nThey are insectivorous, but most species also eat worms, land snails, and fruit. Many species are permanently resident in warm climates, while others migrate to higher latitudes during summer, often over considerable distances.\n\nThrushes build cup-shaped nests, sometimes lining them with mud. They lay two to five speckled eggs, sometimes laying two or more clutches per year. Both parents help in raising the young.\n\nThe songs of some species, including members of the genera Catharus, Myadestes, Sialia and Turdus, are considered to be among the most beautiful in the avian world.  \n\nEcology\n\nTurdidae species spread the seeds of plants, contributing to the dispersal of many species and the recovery of ecosystems.\n\nPlants have limited seed dispersal mobility away from the parent plant and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time.\n\nMany bats and birds rely heavily on fruits for their diet, including birds in the families Cotingidae, Columbidae, Trogonidae, Turdidae, and Rhamphastidae. While eating fruit, these animals swallow seeds and then later regurgitate them or pass them in their faeces. Such ornithochory has been a major mechanism of seed dispersal across ocean barriers.\n\nOther seeds may stick to the feet or feathers of birds, and in this way may travel long distances. Seeds of grasses, spores of algae, and the eggs of molluscs and other invertebrates commonly establish in remote areas after long journeys of this sort. The Turdidae  have a great ecological importance because some populations migrate long distances and disperse the seeds of endangered plant species at new sites, helping to eliminate inbreeding and increasing the genetic diversity of local flora.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nThe taxonomic treatment of this large family has varied significantly in recent years. Traditionally, the Turdidae included the small Old World species, like the nightingale and European robin in the subfamily Saxicolinae, but most authorities now place this group in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae.\n\nThe family formerly included more species. At the time of the publication of the third edition of Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World in 2003, the genera Myophonus, Alethe, Brachypteryx and Monticola were included in Turdidae. Subsequent molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the species in these four genera are more closely related to species in the family Muscicapidae. As a consequence, these four genera are now placed in Muscicapidae. In contrast, the genus Cochoa which had previously been placed in Muscicapidae was shown to belong in Turdidae.\n\nGenera\n\nFAMILY: TURDIDAE\n* Genus Neocossyphus: rufous thrushes (four species) – related to Myadestes\n* Genus Geokichla: (21 species)\n* Genus Zoothera: Asian thrushes (some 15 species, one recently extinct)\n* Genus Ixoreus: varied thrush – related to other New World genera\n* Genus Ridgwayia: Aztec thrush – related to Hylocichla\n* Genus Cataponera: Sulawesi thrush\n\n* Genus Grandala: grandala\n* Genus Sialia: bluebirds (three species)\n* Genus Myadestes: solitaires (10–11 living species, two or three recently extinct, includes formerly recognized genus Phaeornis)\n* Genus Cichlopsis: rufous-brown solitaire – related to Catharus\n* Genus Catharus: typical American thrushes and nightingale-thrushes (12 species)\n* Genus Hylocichla: wood thrush\n* Genus Entomodestes: solitaires (2 species) – related to Catharus\n* Genus Turdus: true thrushes (some 65 species, one recently extinct)\n* Genus Cochoa: cochoas (four species)\n* Genus Chlamydochaera: fruithunter\n\n* Genus Platycichla: (two species) – part of a South American group within Turdus\n* Genus Nesocichla: Tristan thrush or starchy – part of a South American group within Turdus\n\n* Genus Cichlherminia: forest thrush – genus paraphyletic with Turdus\n\n* Genus Psophocichla: groundscraper thrush\n\nNow usually considered a distinct family distantly related to Picathartes:\n\n* Genus Chaetops: rock-jumpers (two species)\n\nFor other species previously in the Turdidae, see Muscicapidae and chats.\nQuestion:\nIf a bird is described as \'Turdoid\', to which family does it belong?\nAnswer:\nMan from uncle\nPassage:\nMarcus Chamat\nMarcus Chamat (pronounced shuh-mat) (born 6 May 1975, in Borlange, Sweden) is a professional eight-ball and nine-ball pool player.

This pretty basin was once a thriving transport hub. Now, traditional narrowboats and elegant black and white iron footbridges sit side-by-side with modern bars and restaurants. Close by is luxury shopping centre the Mailbox, with its stylish clothing shops and cafes.\xa0\nAmong the cargos that once travelled on the canal was chocolate crumb\xa0to the Cadbury factory. Today, this is Cadbury World, a great day out if you have a sweet tooth.\nChocolate and guillotines\nAt Kings Norton Junction, the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal joins under permanently open guillotine gates. Opposite the junction is an attractive toll house with its board showing the charges.\nThe Lickey Hills are pierced by three long tunnels. The canal was realigned to allow the building of the M42. Tardebigge Wharf, with its dry dock, maintenance yard, workers\' cottages, and historic warehouse remains the main base for maintenance on the canal, and is a great place to start a walk.\xa0 It was here that Tom Rolt met Robert Aickman, which led to the creation of the Inland Waterways Association.\nHistoric meeting\nAll 58 locks are in the second half of the canal, as the canal descends through rural Worcestershire. The Tardebigge lock flight has 30 locks in just over two miles, making it the longest in the country.\nHanbury Hall (National Trust) can easily be reached by a pleasant walk across the fields from Astwood Bottom Lock. Hanbury Junction marks the connection with the Droitwich Junction Canal, linked with the Droitwich Barge Canal and offers a route to the River Severn\xa0at Hawford. You might like to take a short walk down the Hanbury Flight, which was rebuilt by volunteers. Hanbury\'s other claim to fame is that it is said to be the real-life counterpart of Radio 4\'s Ambridge, home of The Archers.\nAround Bilford, the countryside is left behind as the canal begins to encroach on the city environs. The Commandery was the headquarters of Charles Stuart before the Battle of Worcester in 1651.\nAhead lies Diglis Basins and two wide locks accessing the Severn. Once very busy with commercial traffic, the working boats have long been replaced by pleasure craft. Worcester Cathedral stares down imposingly on travellers entering the river.\nBoating\nThe Worcester & Birmingham Canal is a justifiably popular cruising route and is now part of both the Avon and Stourport Cruising Rings. With 58 locks in all it is well suited to energetic crews, or those who don\'t mind taking their time.\nDownload Worcester & Birmingham Canal towpath guidance for cyclists\nThe history\nThe purpose of the Worcester & Birmingham Canal was to give a much shorter link between Birmingham and the river Severn.\xa0Against opposition from other canals, it obtained its Act in 1791.\xa0Construction started at the Birmingham end but progress was slow.\xa0The canal was intended to be broad (for boats up to 14ft wide), which is why the first three tunnels have this width, but shortage of money meant that the section from Tardebigge to Worcester was built only wide enough for narrow boats.\xa0It opened throughout in 1815.\nWater supply was a major problem and a source of conflict with connecting canals.\xa0 At first the Birmingham Canal and the W&B were physically separated by what was known as Worcester Bar, but in 1815 they agreed a compromise whereby the two canals would be linked by a lock, with the W&B paying a compensation toll for all traffic passing through.\nThe guillotine lock by Kings Norton Junction on the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal enabled each canal to preserve its water, regardless of the respective levels.\nExperimental vertical boat lift\nTardebigge top lock is particularly deep because it was the site of a experimental vertical boat lift, which proved not to be robust enough.\xa0 After a few months it was replaced by a conventional lock — but as a canal’s water usage is largely determined by its deepest lock, it would have been better if it had been replaced by two locks.\xa0\nThe volume of traffic never lived up to expectations, though it improved once the Gloucester & Berkeley Canal opened in 1827. Salt had been found when the canal was being cut at Stoke Prior, and the industry which developed became an important source of traffic.\xa0 Worcester gas works and other canalside industries used coal brought by the canal.\nRailway competition\nHowever, from 1841 railway competition took away much of the business and in 1868 losses were so severe that a receiver was appointed. The canal was saved by being bought in 1874 by the Sharpness New Docks Company (which by then owned the Gloucester & Sharpness Canal). Under enterprising management new traffic was sought, and the canal survived until nationalisation in 1948.\nThe last commercial traffics were coal from Cannock to Worcester and chocolate crumb from Worcester to Bourneville, ceasing in 1960 and 1961 respectively.\nQuestion:\nThe English cities of Gloucester and Worcester are on which river?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 3497, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 3497, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 8}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

It is constructed in accordance with a detailed set of specifications published by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Its overall length must be at least 260 cm (102.4 inches) and its weight at least 800 grams (1.8 pounds). The women’s javelin is somewhat shorter and lighter—a minimum 220 cm (86.6 inches) long and 600 grams (1.3 pounds) in weight.\nJavelin throw, side view.\nEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.\nAfter a short run, the javelin is thrown directly forward with an over-the-shoulder motion into a 29° sector marked on the field. It must land point first. The thrower’s body may not rotate a full turn (360°) before the javelin is released, and he may not step on or beyond a line at the end of the runway.\nScandinavian athletes dominated the first 50 years of men’s javelin competition. Sweden conducted the first national championship in the event in 1896, and Swedish and Finnish athletes held most world records until 1953. The javelin throw has been an Olympic event since 1908; a women’s javelin event was added to the Olympic program in 1932.\nLearn More in these related articles:\nQuestion:\nWhat Olympic event involves throwing a spear?\nAnswer:\nAkontion\nPassage:\nA Harlot\'s Progress\nA Harlot\'s Progress (also known as The Harlot\'s Progress) is a series of six paintings (1731, now destroyed) and engravings (1732) by the English artist William Hogarth. The series shows the story of a young woman, M. (Moll or Mary) Hackabout, who arrives in London from the country and becomes a prostitute. The series was developed from the third image: having painted a prostitute in her boudoir in a garret on Drury Lane, Hogarth struck upon the idea of creating scenes from her earlier and later life. The title and rich allegory are reminiscent of John Bunyan\'s Pilgrim\'s Progress.\n\nIn the first scene, an old woman praises her beauty and suggests a profitable occupation, procuring her for the gentleman shown towards the back of the image. She is a mistress with two lovers in the second, has become a common prostitute on the point of being arrested in the third, and is beating hemp in Bridewell Prison in the fourth. By the fifth, she is dying from venereal disease, and she is dead aged only 23 in the last.\n\nHistory\n\nThe protagonist ""M. Hackabout"" (see Plate 1, Plate 3, and the coffin-lid in Plate 6, which reads: ""M. Hackabout Died Sepr 2d 1731 Aged 23"") is either named after the heroine of Moll Flanders and Kate Hackabout or ironically after the Blessed Virgin Mary.  Kate was a notorious prostitute and the sister of highwayman Francis Hackabout: he was hanged on 17 April 1730; she was convicted of keeping a disorderly house in August the same year, having been arrested by Westminster magistrate Sir John Gonson.\n\nThe series of paintings proved to be very popular and Hogarth used his experience as an apprentice to a silversmith to create engravings of the images, selling a ""limited edition"" of 1,240 sets of six prints to subscribers for a Guinea. Pirate copies of the engravings were soon in circulation, and Hogarth procured a 1735 Act of Parliament (8 Geo. II. cap. 13) to prohibit the practice. Soon after, Hogarth published his second series of satirical and moralistic images, A Rake\'s Progress, followed some years later by Marriage à-la-mode.\n\nThe original paintings were destroyed in a fire at Fonthill House in 1755, the country house of William Beckford (1709–1770), a politician and father of William Thomas Beckford (1 October 1760 – 2 May 1844) builder of Fonthill Abbey in Wiltshire. The original plates survived, and were sold by Hogarth\'s widow, Jane, to John Boydell in 1789; by him to Baldwin, Cradock and Joy in 1818; and then to Henry Bohn in 1835. Each produced further copies.\n\nAdaptation\n\nBritish composer Iain Bell composed an operatic adaptation of the work which opened at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna in 2013 with German soprano Diana Damrau in the title role. The world premiere of the opera A Harlot\'s Progress was on 13 October 2013. \n\nThe plates\nQuestion:\n‘The Harlot’s Progress’ is a series of paintings and engravings by which 18th Century English painter?\nAnswer:\nHogarthian\nPassage:\nCentral London\nCentral London is the innermost part of London, England. There is no official definition of its area, but its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. Over time a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics, urban planning and local government. \n\nRoad distances to London are traditionally measured from a central point at Charing Cross (in the City of Westminster), which is marked by the statue of King Charles I at the junction of the Strand, Whitehall and Cockspur Street, just south of Trafalgar Square. \n\nCharacteristics\n\nDefinitions\n\nLondon Plan\n\nThe London Plan defines the ""Central Activities Zone"" policy area, which comprises the City of London, most of Westminster and the inner parts of Camden, Islington, Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Lambeth and Kensington and Chelsea.  It is described as ""a unique cluster of vitally important activities including central government offices, headquarters and embassies, the largest concentration of London\'s financial and business services sector and the offices of trade, professional bodies, institutions, associations, communications, publishing, advertising and the media"". \n\nFor strategic planning, since 2011 there has been a Central London sub region comprising the boroughs of Camden, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Southwark, Westminster and the City of London.  From 2004 to 2008, the London Plan included a sub-region called Central London comprising Camden, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Southwark, Wandsworth and Westminster. It had a 2001 population of 1,525,000. The sub-region was replaced in 2008 with a new structure which amalgamated inner and outer boroughs together. This was altered in 2011 when a new Central London sub region was created, now including the City of London and excluding Wandsworth. However, districts at the outer edge of this subregion such as Streatham, Dulwich and Holloway are not generally considered as Central London.\n\nCensus\n\nThe 1901 census defined Central London as the City of London and the metropolitan boroughs of Bermondsey, Bethnal Green, Finsbury, Holborn, Shoreditch, Southwark, Stepney, St Marylebone and Westminster. \n\n1959–1963 proposals for a Central London borough\n\nDuring the Herbert Commission and the subsequent passage of the London Government Bill, three attempts were made to define an area that would form a central London borough. The first two were detailed in the 1959 Memorandum of Evidence of the Greater London Group of the London School of Economics. \n\n\'Scheme A\' envisaged a central London borough, one of 25, consisting of the City of London, Westminster, Holborn, Finsbury and the inner parts of St Marylebone, St Pancras, Chelsea, Southwark and Lambeth. The boundary deviated from existing lines in order to include all central London railway stations, the Tower of London and the museums, such that it included small parts of Kensington, Shoreditch, Stepney and Bermondsey. It had an estimated population of 350,000 and occupied 7000 acre. \n\n\'Scheme B\' delineated central London, as one of 7 boroughs, including most of the City of London, the whole of Finsbury and Holborn, most of Westminster and Southwark, parts of St Pancras, St Marylebone, Paddington and a small part of Kensington. The area had an estimated population of 400,000 and occupied 8000 acre.\n\nDuring the passage of the London Government Bill an amendment was put forward to create a central borough corresponding to the definition used at the 1961 census. It consisted of the City of London, all of Westminster, Holborn and Finsbury; and the inner parts of Shoreditch, Stepney, Bermondsey, Southwark, Lambeth, Chelsea, Kensington, Paddington, St Marylebone and St Pancras. The population was estimated to be 270,000.\nQuestion:\nWhat central London street is famous for containing the main government offices?\nAnswer:\nVerge of the Palaces of St James and Whitehall\nPassage:\nEra (geology)\nA geologic era is a subdivision of geologic time that divides an eon into smaller units of time. The Phanerozoic Eon is divided into three such time frames: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic represent the major stages in the macroscopic fossil record. These eras are separated by catastrophic extinction boundaries, the P-T boundary between the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic and the K-T boundary between the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic. There is evidence that catastrophic meteorite impacts played a role in demarcating the differences between the eras.\n\nThe Hadean, Archean and Proterozoic eons were as a whole formerly called the Precambrian. This covered the four billion years of Earth history prior to the appearance of hard-shelled animals. More recently, however, those eons have been subdivided into eras of their own.\n\nList of geological eras in Earth\'s evolutionary history\nQuestion:\nWhich geological era, spanning the massive time-period between 245 million and 65 million years ago, is divided into three periods named the Triassic, the Jurassic and the Cretaceous ?\nAnswer:\nTHE MESOZOIC ERA\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nfagot - Wiktionary\nfagot - Wiktionary\nfagot\nWhat fool hath added water to the sea, \\ Or brought a fagot to bright-burning Troy?\nAlternative form of faggot (shrivelled old woman)\nAlternative form of faggot (a gay person, particularly a man)\nA bundle of pieces of wrought iron to be worked over into bars or other shapes by rolling or hammering at a welding heat; a pile .\n(music, obsolete ) A fagotto , or bassoon .\n( Britain , obsolete ) A person hired to take the place of another at the muster of a company .\n(Can we find and add a quotation of Addison to this entry?)\nQuestion:\nWhich musical instrument has an Italian name fagotto which means a \'bundle of sticks\'?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 3003, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 3003, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 8}]",4,0.5,28244,7061.0,318.19,122,30.5,1.37,8,0.05,3,37.56873024324932,ml.g5.48xlarge,llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235,meta-textgeneration-llama-2-70b-2024-01-20-17-53-55-754,763104351884.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference:2.0.1-tgi1.1.0-gpu-py39-cu118-ubuntu20.04,s3://jumpstart-private-cache-prod-us-east-1/meta-textgeneration/meta-textgeneration-llama-2-70b/artifacts/inference-prepack/v1.0.0/,3600,/opt/ml/model,4095,4096,/opt/ml/model,1,1,inference.py,8,,,,

It is not unique to the modern kingdom of Cambodia: the same name (i.e. Kamboj/Kambuja) is also found in Burmese and Thai chronicles referring to regions within those kingdoms. In the Indian chronicles the Kambuja were a barbarian (in the sense of non-Indian) people in the area of modern Afghanistan. ""The application to Southeast Asia has no ethnic content and does not imply any migration of peoples from the original Kambuja; the most likely explanation is that, when Indian traders and Brahmins came into contact with local populations some two thousand years ago, they gave them the names of regions which, in their view, were similarly marginal and remote: the peoples of Southeast Asia, like the barbarian Kamboja, had no castes, did not observe proper food prohibitions and had different rules for marriage.""  An origin-myth recorded in the Baksei Chamkrong inscription, dated AD 947, derives Kambuja from Svayambhuva Kamboj, a legendary Indian sage who reached the Indochina peninsula and married a naga princess named Mera, thus uniting the Indian and local races. In this story Kambuja derives from Kambu+ja, and means ""descendants of Kambu."" \n\nPreah Reachanachâk Kampuchea means ""Kingdom of Cambodia"". Etymologically, its components are: Preah- (""sacred""); -reach- (""king, royal, realm"", from Sanskrit); -ana- (from Pāli \', ""authority, command, power""); -châk (from Sanskrit chakra, meaning ""wheel"", a symbol of power and rule).\n\nThe name used on formal occasions, such as political speeches and news programs, is Prâteh Kampuchea (), literally ""the Country of Cambodia"". The colloquial name most used by Khmer people is Srok Khmae (), literally ""Khmer Land"".

It is located in the central section of the Lost River Range, within the Challis National Forest in eastern Custer County.\n\nThe mountain was nameless until it was discovered to be higher than Hyndman Peak, previously regarded as the state\'s highest point. In February 1934, the U.S. Geological Survey named it for William Borah, the prominent senior U.S. Senator from Idaho, who had served for nearly 27 years at the time and was dean of the Senate. An outspoken isolationist, the ""Lion of Idaho"" ran for president two years later in 1936, but did not win the Republican nomination, and died in office in 1940.\n\n1983 earthquake\n\nThe 1983 Borah Peak earthquake occurred on October 28 at 8:06:09 local time in the Lost River Range at Borah Peak in central Idaho, United States, measuring 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale.  Mount Borah rose about 1 foot (.3 m) and the Lost River Valley in that vicinity dropped about 8 feet (2.4 m.).http://www.nps.gov/crmo/learn/nature/geologicactivity.htm  The peak was scarred on the western side, and the mark is still visible.  Two children in Challis were the only fatalities of the quake, struck by falling masonry while walking to elementary school.\n\nClimbing\n\nThe normal route involves ascending 5,262 vertical feet (1604 m) from the trailhead to the summit in just over 3.5 miles (5.6\xa0km). This route on the southwest ridge, the most popular route, is a strenuous hike for the most part until one reaches a Class 4 arête just before the main summit crest. This point is known as Chickenout Ridge as many people will abort the attempt once they see the hazards up close. In the cooler seasons this crossing usually involves a traverse over snow, with steeply slanting slopes on either side. An ice axe, and the ability to use it, is recommended for this section when icy.\n\nBorah Peak\'s north face is one of Idaho\'s only year-round snow climbs and provides a much greater challenge than the normal route.  The face features a number of grade II class 5 routes on mixed terrain.\n\nThree climbers have died on Borah Peak.  Two climbers ascending the northwest ridge in 1977 were killed in an avalanche.

Rate Technical Challenge Only.\nThe system focuses on rating the technical challenge of trails, not the physical exertion. It is not practical to rate both types of difficulty with one system. Consider, for example, a smooth, wide trail that is 20 miles long. The technical challenge of this trail is easy, yet the distance would make the physical exertion difficult. The solution is to independently rate technical challenge, and indicate physical exertion by posting trail length, and possibly even elevation change.\n2. Collect Trail Measurements.\nUse the accompanying table and collect trail measurements for each criteria. There is no prescribed method for tallying a ""score"" for each trail. Evaluate the trail against the table and combine with judgment to reach the final rating. It is unlikely that any particular trail will measure at the same difficulty level for every criteria. For example, a certain trail may rate as a green circle in three criteria, but a blue square in two different criteria.\n3. Include Difficulty and Trail Length on Signs and Maps.\nTrail length is not a criterion of the system. Instead, trail length should be posted on signs in addition to the difficulty symbol. A sign displaying both length and difficulty provides lots of information, yet it is simple to create and easy to understand.\nLikewise, elevation change is not a criterion. The amount of climbing on a trail is more an indicator of physical exertion than technical difficulty. Mountainous regions may consider including the amount of climbing on trail signs.\n4. Evaluate Difficulty Relative to Local Trails.\nTrails should be rated relative to other trails in the region. Don\'t evaluate each trail in isolation. Consider all the trails in a region and how they compare to one another. This will help you rank the relative difficulty of each trail and will help trail users select an appropriate route. Trails will rate differently from region to region. A black diamond trail in one region may rate as a blue square in another region, but the ratings should be consistent locally.\n5. Use Good Judgment.\nRating a trail is not 100 percent objective. Its best to combine tangible data with subjective judgment to reach the final rating. For example, a trail may have a wide range of tread surfaces - most of the trail is easy, but some sections are more difficult. How would you rate it? Use your personal experience to consider all elements and select a rating that best matches the style of trail.\n6. Consider Other Trail Qualities.\nDon\'t forget to consider trail qualities beyond the objective criteria. A wide variety of features could contribute to a trail\'s difficulty. For example, exposure - the feeling of empty space next to and below the trail tread - provides an added psychological challenge beyond the steepness or roughness of the trail. A 3-inch rock seems like a boulder when a 50-foot drop looms on your side! Other qualities to think about are corridor clearance and turn radius.\n7. Use Common Sense and Seek Input.\nNo rating system can be totally objective or valid for every situation. This system is a tool to be combined with common sense. Look at trails with a discerning eye, and seek input from trail users before selecting the rating. Remember, a diverse trail network with a variety of trail styles is a great way to ensure happy visitors. Provide both easy and difficult trails to spread visitors and meet a range of needs. By indicating the length and difficulty of trails with a clear signage system, visitors will be able to locate their preferred type of trail easily.\nCriteria to Consider\nQuestion:\nIn skiing, what colour diamond denotes an expert trail on signs and trail maps?\nAnswer:\nBlackishly\nPassage:\nChemical Elements.com - Phosphorus (P)\nChemical Elements.com - Phosphorus (P)\nContains an ""Introduction to Tungsten"", among other things\nIf you know of any other links for Phosphorus, please let me know\nBentor, Yinon.

He began his career on the European and Southern African tours, but had little success as a player. Having an interest in the techniques, mechanics and psychology of the sport he soon moved into instruction and came to wide notice in the 1980s when he rebuilt the swing of  Nick Faldo, who then went on to win six major championships.\n\nLeadbetter now runs an international chain of golf academies headquartered at the ChampionsGate Golf Club in Davenport, Florida, U.S. which has 36 holes designed by Greg Norman. There are also branches elsewhere in North America and in Europe and Asia. Leadbetter himself concentrates on teaching tour professionals and on instructing other coaches in his methods, who then teach his ideas at his academies. Apart from Faldo his students include Nick Price, Charles Howell III, Michelle Wie, Lydia Ko and Byeong Hun An. Pros who formerly worked with Leadbetter included: Nick Faldo (1984–1998), Greg Norman (1997), and Ernie Els (1990–2008). He was ranked second to Butch Harmon on the 2005-2006 edition of Golf Digest\'s list of the ""50 Greatest Teachers"" in the United States. \n\nLeadbetter has published several books and produced numerous instructional videos and DVDs. His latest book is [http://www.leadbetterAswing.com The A Swing], The Alternative Approach to Great Golf.\n\nLeadbetter and his wife, Kelly (an LPGA Tour professional), their sons Andy and James and their daughter Hally, live in Sarasota, Florida. He is also an endorser/spokesman for SAP, Epson, Callaway, JoS. A. Bank Clothiers, Rolex, and Golf Pride grips.\nQuestion:\nDavid Leadbetter is a famous coach, in which sport?\nAnswer:\nScramble (golf)\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nDanube Waltz River Cruise Videos - 2017 Passau to Budapest\nDanube Waltz River Cruise Videos - 2017 Passau to Budapest\nDanube Waltz River Cruise Videos - 2017 Passau to Budapest\nCall Viking at\nGrand Voyages\nCruise Danube Waltz Explore four of Europe’s most enchanting countries along the storied Danube River; Austria, Germany, Hungary and Slovakia.

The album was originally meant to be entitled Kissing the Beehive; however, due to possible copyright infringements in relation to Jonathan Carroll\'s 1997 novel of the same name, this title was changed. Singer and keyboardist Spencer Krug said that the band ""didn\'t know that was the title of a book... We might have to change it, but we might not. And we\'ll have to make it clear that it\'s not [named] after his book. It\'s a complicated situation."" It had also been reported earlier by Blender that the record was entitled Pardon My Blues; however, on April 28, Sub Pop officially announced that the album\'s name would be At Mount Zoomer.\n\nAlbum overview\nThe band started playing new songs live that would end up on At Mount Zoomer as early as summer 2007. Among the first to be played were ""Language City"" and ""Fine Young Cannibals"".\nAccording to singer and guitarist Dan Boeckner, half of the album was recorded in Farnham, Quebec at Petite Église, an old church that was converted to a recording studio by the band Arcade Fire for the production of their album Neon Bible. After touring the east coast in late 2007, Wolf Parade recorded the rest of At Mount Zoomer at MIXart Studios in Montreal, Quebec. Afterwards, the album was mixed at Arlen Thompson\'s sound studio, Mount Zoomer.The cover art for the album features the work of Matt Moroz and Elizabeth Huey, depicting a battle scene between the two artists.The track ""Call It a Ritual"" was released by the band on April 14, 2008.\n\nReception\nAt Mount Zoomer received positive reviews from critics.

Blow in the Wind features several tracks which are led off with musical mash-ups of, or homages to, classic Punk songs, a trend the group began on their second album, Are a Drag (with an appropriation of ""Generator"" by Bad Religion for their cover of ""My Favorite Things"") and would continue with Take a Break and Ruin Jonny\'s Bar Mitzvah: ""Sloop John B"" samples ""Teenage Lobotomy"" by The Ramones, ""Elenor"" samples ""London Calling"" by The Clash, ""San Francisco"" samples ""Stranger Than Fiction"" by Bad Religion, ""I Only Want to Be With You"" samples and ""The Money Will Roll Right In"" by Fang. Similarly, the track ""Different Drum"" also ends with a guitar riff taken from ""Georgy Girl"" by the Seekers.\nThe first song begins with a clip similar to the hidden track on the NOFX album Punk in Drublic where Fat Mike attempts to find the proper pitch of the word ""how"" in the line ""How did the cat get so fat?"" from ""Perfect Government"".\nThe album is made up entirely of ""Hits of the 1960s"". The band\'s version of ""Different Drum"" can be heard during the credits of the film Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.\nThe band\'s version of ""Sloop John B"" is featured in the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nSpike Slawson - vocals\nChris Shiflett (a.k.a.

The original LP was released with 18 tracks, and later re-released on compact disc with six live bonus tracks.\n\nCritical reception\nThe Austin Chronicle called the album a ""stone classic,"" writing that ""precious few third wave punk-hardcore outfits have aged as stoically – or as relevantly – as vox/guitar sibling duo Kevin Seconds and Steve Youth."" In a retrospective review, Tiny Mix Tapes wrote that the band\'s sound ""is distilled ... to a steady grind of too-pah beats and blender-like three-chord sounds, but it’s the combination of this minimalism and Kevin Seconds’s voice — passionate, melodic, hopeful — that makes you believe everything he says."" LA Weekly placed The Crew at #3 on its list of the top twenty hardcore albums in history, writing that ""7 Seconds wrote the book on positive hardcore and that book is called The Crew.""\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Kevin Seconds, except for where noted.\n\n""Here\'s Your Warning"" - 1:18\n""Definite Choice"" - 0:55\n""Not Just Boys Fun"" (Seconds, Steve Youth) - 1:29\n""This Is the Angry Pt. 2"" - 1:09\n""Straight On"" - 0:24\n""You Lose"" - 0:36\n""What If There\'s a War in America"" - 0:42\n""The Crew"" - 0:51\n""Clenched Fists, Black Eyes"" - 1:30\n""Colourblind"" - 1:42\n""Aim to Please"" - 1:14\n""Boss"" (Seconds, Youth) - 0:45\n""Young \'Til I Die"" - 2:01\n""Red and Black"" - 0:37\n""Die Hard"" - 0:57\n""I Have a Dream"" - 1:00\n""Bully"" - 1:05\n""Trust"" - 2:13\n""Here\'s Your Warning"" (Live) - 1:35\n""Spread"" (Live) - 1:21\n""I Have a Dream"" (Live) - 0:58\n""Young \'Til I Die"" (Live) - 1:51\n""Not Just Boys Fun"" (Live) (Seconds, Youth) - 1:26\n""Rock Together"" (Live) - 2:12\n\nPersonnel\nKevin Seconds: Lead Vocals\nDan Pozniak: Guitar, Vocals\nTroy Mowat: Drums\nSteve Youth: Bass, Piano\nPassage 8:\nFull Length LP\nFull Length LP is the debut album by the Huntington Beach, California punk rock band Guttermouth, released in 1991 by Dr. Strange Records. It introduced the band\'s style of fast, abrasive punk rock with tongue-in-cheek humor and sarcastic lyrics. The album was originally released as an LP but was repackaged the following year as a CD including tracks from the band\'s first 2 EPs Puke and Balls, as well as the previously unreleased tracks ""Malted Vomit"" and ""Ghost."" It was re-released again in 1996 by Nitro Records under the title The Album Formerly Known as Full Length LP.\nThe album proved to be a success for the band, expanding their fan base and giving them opportunities to play shows all over southern California alongside other popular punk rock bands. An animated music video was made for the song “1, 2, 3…Slam!” and played on local punk rock and skateboarding video programs. Many of the songs from Full Length would remain staples in the band\'s live set throughout their career.\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Guttermouth except where noted\n\n""Race Track""\n""No More""\n""Jack La Lanne""\n""Where Was I?""\n""Old Glory""\n""I\'m Punk""\n""Mr. Barbeque""\n""Bruce Lee vs. the Kiss Army""\n""Chicken Box""\n""Carp""\n""Toilet""\n""Oats""\n""1, 2, 3...Slam!""\n""I Used to be 20"" (written & originally performed by the Dayglo Abortions as ""I Used to be in Love"")\n""Reggae Man""\n""Chicken Box"" (again)*\n""Just a Fuck""*\n""Hypocrite""*\n""Marco-Polo""*\n""Under My Skin""*\n""Gas Out""*\n""No Such Thing""*\n""Malted Vomit""*\n""Ghost""**Tracks 16-24 are included on CD re-releases only.

The river flows generally north by northeast through the Eungella National Park and is joined by thirteen minor tributaries, towards its mouth and empties into the Coral Sea north of Bowen. With a catchment area of 1,200 square kilometres (460 sq mi), the river descends 253 metres (830 ft) over its 60-kilometre (37 mi) course.High salinity levels have been recorded at the mouth of the river. Land use in the upper catchment is mostly beef cattle production with crops grown in the richer soils downstream.The river is crossed by the Bruce Highway via the Don River Bridge at Bowen.\n\nFlooding\nThe highest recorded flood was in 1970 when the river reached 7.25 metres (23.8 ft) at the Bowen Pumping Station. The river delta is particularly vulnerable to flooding during cyclones.Floods in 2008 left deposits of sand which raised the riverbed considerably. Approval to dredge sand was granted by the Queensland Government, however only about half of that has been removed in recent years. A flood in 2008 lead the Whitsunday Regional Council to create a channel so that similar flooding could be avoided.A management plan for the river was established late in 2008.  It included measures to encourage further sand extraction.\n\nSee also\n\nList of rivers of Australia § Queensland\nPassage 2:\nBowen River (Queensland)\nThe Bowen River is a river in North Queensland, Australia.\n\nCourse and features\nFormed by the confluence of the Broken River and the Little Bowen River near Tent Hill in the Normanby Range, part of the Great Dividing Range, the Bowen River flows in a north-westerly direction along the base of the range then flows west across Emu Plains and is crossed by the Bowen Developmental Road just north of Havilah. The river then flows north-west again between the Herbert Range and Leichhardt Range then discharges into the Burdekin River, south southeast of Ravenswood. The river descends 98 metres (322 ft) over its 129-kilometre (80 mi) course.The catchment area of the river occupies 9,452 square kilometres (3,649 sq mi) of which an area of 236 square kilometres (91 sq mi) is composed of riverine wetlands. The catchment is in poor condition with much of the riparian habitat having been cleared and prone to erosion. The area is mostly used for cattle grazing with the towns of Collinsville and Glendon both drawing their town water supply from the Bowen River Weir. The river has a mean annual discharge of 1,618 gigalitres (3.56×1011 imp gal; 4.27×1011 US gal).The Bowen River Weir supplies water to a coal mine, power station and the township of Collinsville.\n\nHistory\nThe river was named in 1861 by the Queensland Government, derived from the name of the town Bowen which was named in honour of Sir George Bowen, a  Governor of Queensland.In the 1860s, Richard Daintree made mineral discoveries along the river.

The language region includes areas within the local government area of Maranoa Region, particularly the towns of Charleville, Augathella and Blackall and as well as the Carnarvon Range.Ludwig Leichhardt explored the area in 1844 and named the river in honour of Robert Dawson, one of Leichhardt\'s financial backers.In the 1920s, shortly after the First World War, Australian Labor Party politician Ted Theodore (1884-1950) launched an irrigation program on the Dawson River for returning soldiers. His intentions was to provide them with arable land along the river for them to take up farming, thus eschewing a post-war recession. After the 1922 Irrigation Act was passed, he started irrigation schemes on the Dawson River, for an initial 8,000 new farmers. However, the scheme was abandoned after he realized the soil was unsuitable for farming and the returning soldiers had no agrarian skills.\n\nSee also\n\nBoggomoss\nList of rivers of Australia § Queensland\nPassage 10:\nDee River (Queensland)\nThe Dee River is a river in Central Queensland, Australia.\n\nCourse and features\nPart of the Fitzroy River system, the Dee River rises in the Razorback Range south of Bouldercombe Gorge Resources Reserve near Mount Gavial, south of Bouldercombe.

He was briefly adopted into the Nomura family and became known as Nomura Yakichi, though he was later restored to the Inoue family.\nMasaru Inoue was brought up as the son of a samurai belonging to the Chōshū fief. At 15, he entered the Nagasaki Naval Academy established by the Tokugawa shogunate under the direction of a Dutch naval officer. In 1863, Inoue and four friends from the Chōshū clan stowed away on a vessel to the United Kingdom. He studied civil engineering and mining at University College London and returned to Japan in 1868. After working for the government as a technical officer supervising the mining industry, he was appointed Director of the Railway Board in 1871. Inoue played a leading role in Japan\'s railway planning and construction, including the construction of the Nakasendo Railway, the selection of the alternative route (Tokaido), and the proposals for future mainline railway networks.In 1891 Masaru Inoue founded Koiwai Farm with Yanosuke Iwasaki and Shin Onogi.  After retirement from the government, Inoue founded Kisha Seizo Kaisha, the first locomotive manufacturer in Japan, becoming its first president in 1896. In 1909 he was appointed President of the Imperial Railway Association. He died of an illness in London in 1910, during an official visit on behalf of the Ministry of Railways.\n\nHonors\nInoue and his friends later came to be known as the Chōshū Five. To commemorate their stay in London, two scholarships, known as the Inoue Masaru Scholarships, are available each session under the University College London 1863 Japan Scholarships scheme to enable University College students to study at a Japanese University. The value of the scholarships are £3000 each.\nHis tomb is in the triangular area of land where the Tōkaidō Main Line meets the Tōkaidō Shinkansen in Kita-Shinagawa.\n\nChōshū Five\nThese are the four other members of the ""Chōshū Five"":\n\nItō Shunsuke (later Itō Hirobumii)\nInoue Monta (later Inoue Kaoru)\nYamao Yōzō who later studied engineering at the Andersonian Institute, Glasgow, 1866-68 while working at the shipyards by day\nEndō Kinsuke\n\nSee also\nJapanese students in Britain\nStatue of Inoue Masaru\nPassage 6:\nCleomenes II\nCleomenes II (Greek: Κλεομένης; died 309 BC) was king of Sparta from 370 to 309 BC. He was the second son of Cleombrotus I, and grandfather of Areus I, who succeeded him. Although he reigned for more than 60 years, his life is completely unknown, apart from a victory at the Pythian Games in 336 BC. Several theories have been suggested by modern historians to explain such inactivity, but none has gained consensus.\n\nLife and reign\nCleomenes was the second son of king Cleombrotus I (r.\u2009380–371), who belonged to the Agiad dynasty, one of the two royal families of Sparta (the other being the Eurypontids). Cleombrotus died fighting Thebes at the famous Battle of Leuctra in 371. His eldest son Agesipolis II succeeded him, but he died soon after in 370. Cleomenes\' reign was instead exceptionally long, lasting 60 years and 10 months according to Diodorus of Sicily, a historian of the 1st century BC. In a second statement, Diodorus nevertheless tells that Cleomenes II reigned 34 years, but he confused him with his namesake Cleomenes I (r.\u2009524–490).\n\nDespite the outstanding length of his reign, very little can be said about Cleomenes. He has been described by modern historians as a ""nonentity"". Perhaps that the apparent weakness of Cleomenes inspired the negative opinion of the hereditary kingship at Sparta expressed by Aristotle in his Politics (written between 336 and 322). However, Cleomenes may have focused on internal politics within Sparta, because military duties were apparently given to the Eurypontid Agesilaus II (r.\u2009400–c.360), Archidamus III (r.\u2009360–338), and Agis III (r.\u2009338–331). As the Spartans notably kept their policies secret from foreign eyes, it would explain the silence of ancient sources on Cleomenes. Another explanation is that his duties were assumed by his elder son Acrotatus, described as a military leader by Diodorus, who mentions him in the aftermath of the Battle of Megalopolis in 331, and again in 315.Cleomenes\' only known deed was his chariot race victory at the Pythian Games in Delphi in 336. In the following autumn, he gave the small sum of 510 drachmas for the reconstruction of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 373. Cleomenes might have made this gift as a pretext to go to Delphi and engage in informal diplomacy with other Greek states, possibly to discuss the consequences of the recent assassination of the Macedonian king Philip II.One short witticism of Cleomenes regarding cockfighting is preserved in the Moralia, written by the philosopher Plutarch in the early 2nd century AD:\nSomebody promised to give to Cleomenes cocks that would die fighting, but he retorted, ""No, don\'t, but give me those that kill fighting.""\nAs Acrotatus died before Cleomenes, the latter\'s grandson Areus I succeeded him while still very young, so Cleomenes\' second son Cleonymus acted as regent until Areus\' majority. Some modern scholars also give Cleomenes a daughter named Archidamia, who played an important role during Pyrrhus\' invasion of the Peloponnese, but the age difference makes it unlikely.\nPassage 7:\nYasuichi Oshima\nYasuichi Oshima (大島 やすいち, Ōshima Yasuichi, born 24 March 1954 in Kyoto) is a Japanese manga artist.

Hucknall achieved international fame in the 1980s as the lead singer and songwriter of the soul-influenced pop band Simply Red, with whom he enjoyed a 25-year career and sold over 50 million albums. Hucknall is recognisable for his smooth, distinctive voice and wide vocal range, as well as his red curly hair, and has been described as ""one of the truly great blue-eyed soul singers"". \n\nEarly life\n\nHucknall, born at St Mary\'s Hospital, Manchester,   was an only child. His mother abandoned the family when he was three; the upheaval caused by this event inspired him to write ""Holding Back the Years,"" which would become one of Simply Red\'s biggest and best-known hits. He was brought up by his father, Reginald (1935–2009),  a barber in Stockport.  He attended Audenshaw School.  It would not be until the mid-1990s that he would finally reconnect with his mother, Maureen, who was by then living in Dallas. As of a 2008 interview, he had only seen her on two occasions since she first abandoned the family. \n\nMusic career \n\nHucknall was among the people present at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester in June 1976 where the Sex Pistols were playing.  His interest in the music scene led to the launch of his career in the late 1970s, when he was part of the formation of the band Frantic Elevators.\n\nThe Frantic Elevators released four singles, including a version of ""Holding Back the Years"", which he later recorded with Simply Red.\n\nAs lead singer and core member of Simply Red, he became the identifiable face of the band. His face and long curly red hair were featured prominently on album artwork and in videos.\n\nHucknall is also one of the founders and financial backers of the successful reggae label Blood and Fire. He also manages the record label simplyred.com.\n\nIn October 2007, on David Jensen\'s show on the Gold network, he announced Simply Red would split in 2009. \n\nIn 2008 Hucknall released his first solo album Tribute to Bobby, a tribute to the blues musician Bobby ""Blue"" Bland. \n\nIn June 2009, Hucknall took part in Songbook as part of the Sky Arts series, whereby music artists reflect on their favourite compositions and their background history in music.\n\nIn October 2009, Mick appeared at a charity performance as vocalist for a re-formed version of Faces, replacing Rod Stewart. In May 2010, it was announced that the new Faces line-up with Mick as frontman would be performing festival shows in 2010, followed by a world tour in 2011. \n\nIn October 2012, he released American Soul, a collection of his favourite music re-recorded with his vocals. During a series of interviews promoting the American Soul album, Hucknall revealed that he has also been working on an album of original material, to be released after American Soul has reached the end of its life cycle.\n\nPolitics \n\nHucknall is active in politics and is a prominent celebrity supporter of the UK Labour Party. In 1997, he declared his support for the Labour Party at that year\'s general election – which it won by a landslide under the leadership of Tony Blair to return to government after 18 years in opposition.  In 1998 Hucknall was named in a list of those who donated more than £5,000 to the party.  In 2003, Hucknall backed Tony Blair\'s stance on Operation Iraqi Freedom, claiming he had ""more respect for Blair than ever"" and pointed out that British critics of the war were lucky to be living in a country where they could express their opinions. However, he claimed in 2008 that his conscience prevented him from donating to the party again because of the war, although he would still vote for them. \n\nHucknall has commented that derogatory references to his red hair are a form of bigotry. \n\nHucknall was a guest on the panel for the BBC\'s political discussion series Question Time, broadcast on 27 March 2014, and declared his support for same-sex marriage. \n\nPersonal life\n\nHucknall and his partner, Gabriella Wesberry, had a daughter, Romy True Hucknall, in June 2007.  Hucknall and Wesberry married in 2010, at the 16th-century Forter Castle in Glenisla, Perthshire, Scotland.  He spends a considerable amount of time in Ireland, where he purchased the Glenmore Estate near the village of Cloghan, County Donegal, with bandmate Chris De Margary. Hucknall and De Margary are keen fishermen, and operate a fishing and hunting tourism business from the estate.  \n\nHe co-owns Ask Property Development, a company that constructs city squares and public buildings. \n\nHe spends much time in Catania, Sicily, where he produces wines under the label ""Il Cantante"" (The Singer). \n\nHucknall is a Manchester United fan. \n\nHe has dated a handful of celebrities throughout his career.  In 2010, Hucknall admitted that in his most successful years, between 1985 and 1987, he would have sex with about three women a day and described himself as a sex addict. \n\nSolo discography\n\nAlbums\n\nSingles\n\nOther appearances\n\nIn 1986, he provided backup vocals for the musical film Little Shop of Horrors.\nQuestion:\nWhat is Mick Hucknell\'s band?\nAnswer:\nSimply Red\nPassage:\nThe Absinthe Drinker - Pablo Picasso - WikiArt.org ...\nThe Absinthe Drinker, 1901 - Pablo Picasso - WikiArt.org\nThe Absinthe Drinker\nit is a historically significant artwork\nthe image is only being used for informational and educational purposes\nthe image is readily available on the internet\nthe image is a low resolution copy of the original artwork and is unsuitable for commercial use\nMore …\nWikiArt.org allows unlimited copying, distributing and displaying of the images of public domain artworks solely.

Merrie Melodies cartoon, directed by Robert McKimson and written by Tedd Pierce starring Bennie the fat cat and George. It was animated in 1952. Voices by Mel Blanc and music by Carl Stalling. It was the first appearance of Speedy Gonzales, in a prototype form.  Because this cartoon\'s rendition of Speedy Gonzales looked rather coarse, they redesigned him for future cartoon releases.\n\nPlot\n\nThe two cats pursuing Speedy in Cat-Tails for Two are the slow-witted (and injury-causing) Benny and the fully functioning but unfortunate George, both patterned after the characters Lennie and George in the novel Of Mice and Men. George and Benny are walking down a pier looking for food, when they find a Mexican ship. Figuring the ship will have plenty of Mexican mice, i.e. ""Mexican food"" (Benny: ""It gives me the heartburn and I love it!""), they climb on, only to find an unkempt mouse calling himself ""Speedy Gonzales: Fastest Mouse in All Mexico"".\n\nGeorge and Benny go through numerous attempts to capture Speedy, who always outwits them. Speedy comes to think of them as private entertainment, at one point declaring ""I like those fellows. All the time having fon (fun)!"" Among the cats\' failed attempts:\n\n1. A crate full of ""Acme Anvils"" set above a piece of cheese. With Benny holding the rope and George setting the bait, Speedy gives Benny a scare from behind, causing him to let go of the rope and the crate to flatten George. As punishment, George swings down on Benny\'s cranium with a mallet, but the mallet bounces off Benny\'s head right on top of his own! When Benny asks ""Why did you hit yourself on the head for, George?"", the slap-happy cat answers: ""I like it, I like it!!""\n\n2. George sets up seven pieces of cheese with dynamite-stick booby traps throughout the ship, but doesn\'t have a match to light the sticks. Speedy taunts George with a match and sets him up to take the explosions. Benny comes to the rescue by cooling George down, but misinterprets a bucket of petrol as ""a funny way to spell \'water\'"" leaving him half furless.\n\n3. A pipe with one end disguised as an entranceway to a cabaret and Benny standing at the other end with a mallet. When Speedy enters the pipe, George fires a skyrocket in behind him, the idea being to force Speedy out into the path of the mallet. But the rocket unexpectedly yanks George through the pipe behind it. Speedy is too fast for Benny, and Benny ends up clobbering George when he is pulled out the other side turning his head into a mallet size.\n\nFinally, the two cats run a pipe into Speedy\'s hiding place (to the tune of Raymond Scott\'s Powerhouse), but Speedy grabs a wrench and bends the pipe back around to the cats, unbeknownst to them. George starts shoving a lot of dynamite into the pipe, resulting in a mountain of TNT piling up behind him and Benny. When George is done shoving dynamite through the pipe, he lights the last stick with a match, and the mountain of dynamite blasts him and Benny up into the air. As they descend, Benny asks George about their Mexican dinner, with George responding ""I kind of lost my appetite for Mexican food,"" before both cats plunge into the harbor. A smug Speedy looks at the camera and declares ""I love those fellows. They\'re so see-lee (silly)!""

Hucknall achieved international fame in the 1980s as the lead singer and songwriter of the soul-influenced pop band Simply Red, with whom he enjoyed a 25-year career and sold over 50 million albums. Hucknall is recognisable for his smooth, distinctive voice and wide vocal range, as well as his red curly hair, and has been described as ""one of the truly great blue-eyed soul singers"". \n\nEarly life\n\nHucknall, born at St Mary\'s Hospital, Manchester,   was an only child. His mother abandoned the family when he was three; the upheaval caused by this event inspired him to write ""Holding Back the Years,"" which would become one of Simply Red\'s biggest and best-known hits. He was brought up by his father, Reginald (1935–2009),  a barber in Stockport.  He attended Audenshaw School.  It would not be until the mid-1990s that he would finally reconnect with his mother, Maureen, who was by then living in Dallas. As of a 2008 interview, he had only seen her on two occasions since she first abandoned the family. \n\nMusic career \n\nHucknall was among the people present at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester in June 1976 where the Sex Pistols were playing.  His interest in the music scene led to the launch of his career in the late 1970s, when he was part of the formation of the band Frantic Elevators.\n\nThe Frantic Elevators released four singles, including a version of ""Holding Back the Years"", which he later recorded with Simply Red.\n\nAs lead singer and core member of Simply Red, he became the identifiable face of the band. His face and long curly red hair were featured prominently on album artwork and in videos.\n\nHucknall is also one of the founders and financial backers of the successful reggae label Blood and Fire. He also manages the record label simplyred.com.\n\nIn October 2007, on David Jensen\'s show on the Gold network, he announced Simply Red would split in 2009. \n\nIn 2008 Hucknall released his first solo album Tribute to Bobby, a tribute to the blues musician Bobby ""Blue"" Bland. \n\nIn June 2009, Hucknall took part in Songbook as part of the Sky Arts series, whereby music artists reflect on their favourite compositions and their background history in music.\n\nIn October 2009, Mick appeared at a charity performance as vocalist for a re-formed version of Faces, replacing Rod Stewart. In May 2010, it was announced that the new Faces line-up with Mick as frontman would be performing festival shows in 2010, followed by a world tour in 2011. \n\nIn October 2012, he released American Soul, a collection of his favourite music re-recorded with his vocals. During a series of interviews promoting the American Soul album, Hucknall revealed that he has also been working on an album of original material, to be released after American Soul has reached the end of its life cycle.\n\nPolitics \n\nHucknall is active in politics and is a prominent celebrity supporter of the UK Labour Party. In 1997, he declared his support for the Labour Party at that year\'s general election – which it won by a landslide under the leadership of Tony Blair to return to government after 18 years in opposition.  In 1998 Hucknall was named in a list of those who donated more than £5,000 to the party.  In 2003, Hucknall backed Tony Blair\'s stance on Operation Iraqi Freedom, claiming he had ""more respect for Blair than ever"" and pointed out that British critics of the war were lucky to be living in a country where they could express their opinions. However, he claimed in 2008 that his conscience prevented him from donating to the party again because of the war, although he would still vote for them. \n\nHucknall has commented that derogatory references to his red hair are a form of bigotry. \n\nHucknall was a guest on the panel for the BBC\'s political discussion series Question Time, broadcast on 27 March 2014, and declared his support for same-sex marriage. \n\nPersonal life\n\nHucknall and his partner, Gabriella Wesberry, had a daughter, Romy True Hucknall, in June 2007.  Hucknall and Wesberry married in 2010, at the 16th-century Forter Castle in Glenisla, Perthshire, Scotland.  He spends a considerable amount of time in Ireland, where he purchased the Glenmore Estate near the village of Cloghan, County Donegal, with bandmate Chris De Margary. Hucknall and De Margary are keen fishermen, and operate a fishing and hunting tourism business from the estate.  \n\nHe co-owns Ask Property Development, a company that constructs city squares and public buildings. \n\nHe spends much time in Catania, Sicily, where he produces wines under the label ""Il Cantante"" (The Singer). \n\nHucknall is a Manchester United fan. \n\nHe has dated a handful of celebrities throughout his career.  In 2010, Hucknall admitted that in his most successful years, between 1985 and 1987, he would have sex with about three women a day and described himself as a sex addict. \n\nSolo discography\n\nAlbums\n\nSingles\n\nOther appearances\n\nIn 1986, he provided backup vocals for the musical film Little Shop of Horrors.\nQuestion:\nWhat is Mick Hucknell\'s band?\nAnswer:\nSimply Red\nPassage:\nThe Absinthe Drinker - Pablo Picasso - WikiArt.org ...\nThe Absinthe Drinker, 1901 - Pablo Picasso - WikiArt.org\nThe Absinthe Drinker\nit is a historically significant artwork\nthe image is only being used for informational and educational purposes\nthe image is readily available on the internet\nthe image is a low resolution copy of the original artwork and is unsuitable for commercial use\nMore …\nWikiArt.org allows unlimited copying, distributing and displaying of the images of public domain artworks solely.

He had a period as a Bevin Boy down Bold Colliery before serving as a Marconi wireless operator in the Merchant Navy during World War II. After the war, having literary aspirations but not knowing how to pursue them, he became a bus driver with Liverpool City Transport;  here he worked with Harold Hargreaves Harrison, the father of George Harrison.\n\nHis first marriage in 1945 to Evelyn M Howarth was later dissolved. While still driving buses in Liverpool he met local school teacher Joan Thomas; she encouraged him to start writing by renting a typewriter for him when he could not afford to do so for himself. She hired him the cheapest available, a pink model as these were not suitable for offices because of their bright colour. The couple married in Liverpool in 1964. Initially his short stories and articles were published in Australian magazines before he made the break into writing for television.\n\nTelevision writing\n\nAbraham\'s writing for television included Coronation Street (1960), The Verdict is Yours (1962), Suspense (1963), The Villains (1964), No Hiding Place (1960-1964), Catch Hand (1964), Londoners (1965), King of the River (1966), Z-Cars (1967), The Expert (1968), The First Lady (1969), Dixon of Dock Green (1969), Counterstrike (1969), Paul Temple (1969-1970), Owen, M.D. (1971-1972), and The Onedin Line (1971-1980). \n\nThe Onedin Line\n\nAbraham had originally envisaged The Onedin Line as being about a modern shipping company with its boardroom battles and seagoing adventures, but then he discovered that almost all such companies were run by boards of anonymous executives. However, he noticed that most of these companies had their origins in the 19th century, mostly started by one shrewd and far-sighted individual who, through his own business acumen, built up a shipping line from nothing.McLeay, Alison. The World of the Onedin Line David & Charles (1977) pg 9 Abraham stated that James Onedin was not based on one individual but was rather an amalgamation of several characters. Suggested real-life inspirations include Victorian era shipping line owner James Baines & Co. of Liverpool (a leading character in the series was named \'Captain Baines\'), Sir Samuel Cunard and the Allan Line.\n\nThe Onedin Line first appeared as a one-off BBC Drama Playhouse production transmitted on 7 December 1970; this is now lost. Like the series which was to follow, it was set in Abraham\'s native Liverpool. Initially Abraham struggled to come up with a title for the drama. An article in Woman magazine published in July 1973 featured an interview with Abraham in which he recalled how he came up with the very unusual family name Onedin. He wanted something unique, he said, and had already decided to call the leading male character James but still had not found a surname. Then came some inspiration - he said:\n\nThe  drama so impressed the powers that be at the BBC that a 15-part series was commissioned, with the first episode of Series 1 being transmitted on 15 October 1971; Abraham wrote six episodes in this first series. In total he went on to write 22 of the 91 episodes, which were shown over 8 series. He continued to be involved in the series until his death in 1979.\n\nNovels\n\nAbraham wrote five of the six novels based on the series, namely The Shipmaster (1972), The Iron Ships (1974), The High Seas (1975), The Trade Winds (1977) and The White Ships (1979). \n\nThe books are not straightforward novelisations of the television episodes, since the author introduced additional material and also changed a number of details, though dialogue from the series that Abraham had penned himself is utilised. A series of Onedin short stories by Abraham, set between Series Two and Series Three, appeared in Woman magazine in 1973.\n\nAbraham had intended to write a whole series of novels about the Onedin Line, but he died in 1979 after completing the fifth book, The White Ships. The saga was eventually to have seen James and Elizabeth Onedin as two elderly autocrats, both determined not to relinquish their hold on the shipping business. Elizabeth Onedin would have still been a formidable woman in her 90s, while James Onedin would have died aged 102, leaving the family divided over control of the company.  Abraham had intended the Onedin story to continue right up to the 1970s, following the progress of the descendants of Charlotte Onedin and William Frazer, played by Laura Hartong and Marc Harrison in the TV series.\n\nAbraham, a heavy drinker, died of liver failure in 1979 aged 64 in Manley in Cheshire where he and Joan lived.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id\nVHQ7AwAAQBAJ&pgPT11&lpg\nPT11&dqcyril+abraham+onedin&source\nbl&otssjmZSBLT-P&sig\nddpgz5vQ2VvxmvNiZcaK5hUJmhQ&hlen&sa\nX&eiQzYHVY2lKoT4yQPDo4DoDQ&ved\n0CCkQ6AEwBTgK#vonepage&q\ncyril%20abraham%20onedin&f=false Dawe, Christine Merseyside\'s Own The History Press (2012)  Google Books] After Joan\'s death in 2014 Cyril Abraham\'s archive of scripts, letters and other documents became available for sale on eBay and other sites.\nQuestion:\nThe novels ‘The Shipmaster, ‘The Iron Ships’ and ‘The Trade Winds’ by Cyril Abraham, are based on which 1970’s British tv series?\nAnswer:\nMedusa (fictional ship)\nPassage:\nBurin\nBurin from the French burin meaning ""cold chisel""  has two specialised meanings for types of tools in English, one meaning a  steel cutting tool which is the essential tool of engraving, and the other, in archaeology, meaning a special type of lithic flake with a chisel-like edge which was probably also used for engraving, or for carving wood or bone.\n\nPrintmaking\n\nAn engraving burin is used predominantly by intaglio engravers, but also by relief printmakers in making wood engravings. Its older English name, still often used, is graver. The burin consists of a rounded handle shaped like a mushroom, and a tempered steel shaft, coming from the handle at an angle, and ending in a very sharp cutting face.\n\nIn use, it is typically held at approximately a 30-degree angle to the surface. The index and middle finger typically guide the shaft, while the handle is cradled in the palm. Of note is the 16th-century Flemish engraver Hendrik Goltzius, whose malformed hand was ideally suited for the cradling and guiding of a burin.\n\nBurins typically have a square or lozenge shape face, though several other types are used. A tint burin consists of a square face with teeth, enabling the creation of many fine, closely spaced lines. A stipple tool allows for the creation of  fine dots. A flat burin consists of a rectangular face, and is used for cutting away large portions of material at a time.\n\nArchaeology\n\nIn the field of lithic reduction, a burin is a special type of lithic flake with a chisel-like edge which prehistoric humans may have used for engraving or for carving wood or bone.  Burins exhibit a feature called a ""burin spall"", in which toolmakers strike a small flake obliquely from the edge of the burin flake in order to form the graving edge. Burin usage is diagnostic of Upper Palaeolithic cultures in Europe, but archaeologists have also identified it in North American cultural assemblages, and in his book Early Man in China, Prof. Dr. Jia Lanpo of Beijing University lists dihedral burins and burins for truncation among artifacts uncovered along the banks of the Liyigon river near Xujiayao.\n\nAn example of a type of burin diagnostic of the archaeological stratum where they are found is the ""Noailles"" burin,   a small multiple burin characteristic of the Upper Paleolithic cultural stage called the Gravettian, ca. 28–23,000 BP; these flake tools have been restruck and refined to give several chisellike edges and a blunt, grippable rear edge.\n\nGallery\n\n \nImage:Buril diedro.png |Dihedral burin on a blade \nImage:Burin caréné.png|Carinated burin with multiple facets \nImage:Burin 213 5 Global.jpg| Burin – Upper Paleolithic (Gravettian) (ca. 29,000–22,000 BP) – Brassempouy – Muséum of Toulouse\nQuestion:\nWho would normally use a tool called a \'Burin\' in his work?\nAnswer:\nEngraving\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nCary Grant - The Movie Database (TMDb)\nCary Grant — The Movie Database (TMDb)\nReport\nBiography\nOnce told by an interviewer, ""Everybody would like to be Cary Grant"", Grant is said to have replied, ""So would I.""\nCary Grant was born Archibald Alexander Leach in Horfield, Bristol, England, to Elsie Maria (Kingdon) and Elias James Leach, who worked in a factory. His early years in Bristol would have been an ordinary lower-middle-class childhood, except for one extraordinary event. At age nine, he came home from school one day and was told his mother had gone off to a seaside resort. The real truth, however, was that she had been placed in a mental institution, where she would remain for years, and he was never told about it (he wouldn\'t see his mother again until he was in his late 20s). He left school at fourteen, lying about his age and forging his father\'s signature on a letter to join Bob Pender\'s troupe of knockabout comedians. He learned pantomime as well as acrobatics as he toured with the Pender troupe in the English provinces, picked up a Cockney accent in the music halls in London, and then in July 1920, was one of the eight Pender boys selected to go to the US. Their show on Broadway, ""Good Times,"" ran for 456 performances, giving Grant time to acclimatize. He would stay in America. Mae West wanted Grant for She Done Him Wrong (1933) because she saw his combination of virility, sexuality and the aura and bearing of a gentleman. Grant was young enough to begin the new career of fatherhood when he stopped making movies at age 62. One biographer said Grant was alienated by the new realism in the film industry. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he had invented a man-of-the-world persona and a style--""high comedy with polished words."" In To Catch a Thief (1955), he and Grace Kelly were allowed to improvise some of the dialogue. They knew what the director, Alfred Hitchcock, wanted to do with a scene, they rehearsed it, put in some clever double entendres that got past the censors, and then the scene was filmed.

The word ""coven"" remained largely unused in English until 1921 when Margaret Murray promoted the idea, now much disputed, that all witches across Europe met in groups of thirteen which they called ""covens.""  \n\nNeopaganism\n\nIn Wicca and other similar forms of modern neopagan witchcraft, such as Stregheria and Feri, a coven is a gathering or community of witches, much like a congregation in Christian parlance. It is composed of a group of believers who gather together for ceremonies of worship such as Drawing Down the Moon, or celebrating the Sabbats.\nThe number of persons involved may vary. Although thirteen is considered ideal (probably in deference to Murray\'s theories), any group of at least three can be a coven. A group of two is usually called a ""working couple"" (regardless of their sexes). Within the community, many believe that a coven larger than thirteen is unwieldy, citing unwieldy group dynamics and an unfair burden on the leadership.  When a coven has grown too large to be manageable, it may split, or ""hive"". In Wicca this may also occur when a newly made High Priest or High Priestess, also called 3rd Degree ordination, leaves to start their own coven.\nWiccan covens are usually jointly led by a High Priestess and a High Priest, though some are led by only one or the other. In more recent forms of neopagan witchcraft, covens are sometimes run as democracies with a rotating leadership.\n\nOnline covens\n\nWith the rise of the internet as a platform for collaborative discussion and media dissemination, it became popular for adherents and practitioners of Wicca to establish (often paid subscription-based) ""online covens"" which remotely teach tradition-specific crafts to students in a similar method of education as non-religious virtual online schools.\n\nOne of the first online covens to take this route is the Coven of the Far Flung Net, which was established in 1998 as the online arm of the Church of Universal Eclectic Wicca.\n\nHowever, because of potentially-unwieldy membership sizes, many online covens limit their memberships to anywhere between 10 and 100 students. The CFFN, in particular, tried to devolve its structure into a system of sub-coven clans (which governed their own application processes), a system which ended in 2003 due to fears by the CFFN leadership that the clans were becoming communities in their own right.\n\nUsage in literature and popular culture \n\nIn fantasy stories and popular culture, a coven is a gathering of witches to work spells in tandem.  Such imagery can be traced back to Renaissance prints depicting witches and to the three ""weird sisters"" in Shakespeare\'s Macbeth. Orgiastic meetings of witches are also depicted in the Robert Burns poem ""Tam o\' Shanter"" and in the Goethe play Faust. Movies featuring covens include Suspiria, Rosemary\'s Baby, Four Rooms, The Covenant, Underworld, Underworld: Evolution, The Craft, Coven, Paranormal Activity 3 and  The Witch.\n\nIn television, covens have been portrayed in U.S. supernatural dramas Charmed, Witches of East End, The Originals, The Secret Circle and True Blood. In the 1967 Star Trek original series episode ""Catspaw"", three witches appeared as illusions and acted in unison to voice a warning to Kirk and the landing party to leave the planet. The third season of American Horror Story is titled Coven and focuses on witches.\n\nIn novels such as The Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice and the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer, covens are families or unrelated groups of vampires who live together.\nQuestion:\nWhat is a group of witches called?\nAnswer:\nCoven\nPassage:\nJohanna Spyri\nJohanna Louise Spyri (née Heusser) (; 12 June 1827 – 7 July 1901) was a Swiss-born author of novels, notably children\'s stories, and is best known for her book Heidi. Born  in the rural area of Hirzel, Switzerland, as a child she spent several summers in the area around Chur in Graubünden, the setting she later would use in her novels.\n\nBiography\n\nIn 1852, Johanna Heusser married Bernhard Spyri. Bernhard was a lawyer. While living in the city of Zürich she began to write about life in the country. Her first story, A Note on Vrony\'s Grave, which deals with a woman\'s life of domestic violence, was published in 1880; the following year further stories for both adults and children appeared, among them the novel Heidi, which she wrote in four weeks. Heidi is the story of an orphan girl who lives with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps, and is famous for its vivid portrayal of that landscape.\n\nHer husband and her only child, named Bernard, both died in 1884. Alone, she devoted herself to charitable causes and wrote over fifty more stories before her death in 1901. She was interred in the family plot at the Sihlfeld-A Cemetery in Zürich. An icon in Switzerland, Spyri\'s portrait was placed on a postage stamp in 1951 and on a 20 CHF commemorative coin in 2009.\n\nIn April 2010 a professor searching for children\'s illustrations found a book written in 1830 by a German history teacher, Hermann Adam von Kamp, that Johanna may have used as a basis for Heidi. The 1830 story is titled Adelheide - das Mädchen vom Alpengebirge—translated, ""Adelaide, the girl from the Alps"". The two stories share many similarities in plot line and imagery. Spyri biographer Regine Schindler said it was entirely possible that Johanna may have been familiar with the story as she grew up in a literate household with many books.[http://www.3sat.de/dynamic/sitegen/bin/sitegen.php?tab\n2&source=/kulturzeit/themen/143450/index.html Ur-Heidi aus dem Ruhrpott.

The translations into English at the end of the 19th century, or the early 1900s, mention H. A. Melcon (1839-1910), Marie Louise Kirk (1860-1936), Emma Stelter Hopkins, Louise Brooks, Helen B. Dole and the couple Charles Wharton Stork and Elisabeth P. Stork.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name of the little girl in the popular children\'s novel by Johanna Spyri?\nAnswer:\nHeidi.\nPassage:\nGarigliano\nThe Garigliano is a river in central Italy.\n\nIt forms at the confluence of the rivers Gari (also known as the Rapido) and Liri. Garigliano is actually a deformation of ""Gari-Lirano"" (which in Italian means something like ""Gari from the Liri""). In ancient times the whole course of the Liri and Gagliano was known as the Liris.\n\nFor the most part of its 40 km length, the Garigliano River marks the border between the Italian regions of Lazio and Campania. In medieval times, the river (then known as the Verde) marked the southern border of the Papal States.\n\nHistorical significance\n\nIn the 9th and early 10th centuries a band of Arabs established themselves on the banks of the Garigliano, from where they launched frequent raids on Campania and central Italy. In 915 a coalition of the pope, the Byzantines, Franks, Lombards, and Naples defeated the Garigliano Arabs in the Battle of Garigliano.\n\nIn 1503 Spanish and French forces fought another battle of Garigliano, in which Piero II de\' Medici was drowned, thus control of the Medici family passed to Giovanni de\' Medici, later Pope Leo X. The bigger French Army was practically destroyed at little cost to the Spanish, with the remnants later surrendering at Gaeta.\n\nDuring the Italian Campaign of World War II, the Liri-Gari-Garigliano rivers stood at the centre of a system of German defensive lines (the most famous of which is the Gustav Line) around which the battle of Monte Cassino took place in 1943-1944. Rumours tell that the waters of the river ran red in the Cassino area during the famous battle, because of the blood of the many corpses of soldiers.\n\nNuclear power plant \n\nFrom 1959 until 1982 there has been a BWR nuclear power plant named Garigliano near the town Sessa Aurunca.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name of the line of fortification that ran across Italy during World War II from just north of where the Garigliano River flows into the Tyrrhenian Sea in the west, through the Apennine Mountains to the mouth of the Sangro River on the Adriatic coast in the east via Monte Cassino and Monte Cairo?\nAnswer:\nWinter Line\nPassage:\nNational Rail Enquiries - Station facilities for ...\nNational Rail Enquiries - Station facilities for Warrington Bank Quay\nYes\nPlusBike (cycle hire)\nBrompton Bike Hire is available at the station. \xa0They have two tariffs to chose from; frequent and leisure. \xa0Each has an annual membership fee and a daily hire charge. \xa0Please\xa0 click here \xa0for more information.\nCar Park\nWarrington Bank Quay Car Park 1 - Parker Street\nOperator\nQuestion:\nWBQ is the National Rail code for which station in the North West?\nAnswer:\nWarrington Bank Quay railway station\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nHoy (boat)\nA hoy was a  small sloop-rigged coasting ship or  a heavy barge used for freight, usually with a burthen of about 60 tons (bm).  The word derives from the  Middle Dutch hoey. In 1495, one of the Paston Letters included the phrase, An hoye of Dorderycht (a hoy of Dordrecht), in such a way as to indicate that such contact was then no more than mildly unusual. The English term was first used on the Dutch Heude-ships that entered service with the British Royal Navy.\n\nEvolution and use\n\nOver time the hoy evolved in terms of its design and use. In the fifteenth century a hoy might be a small spritsail-rigged warship like a cromster. Like the earlier forms of the French chaloupe, it could be a heavy and unseaworthy harbour boat or a small coastal sailing vessel (latterly, the chaloupe was a pulling cutter – nowadays motorized). By the 18th and 19th Century hoys were sloop-rigged and the mainsail could be fitted with or without a boom. English hoys tended to be single-masted, whereas Dutch hoys had two masts.\nPrincipally, and more so latterly, the hoy was a passenger or cargo boat. For the English, a hoy was a ship working in the Thames Estuary and southern North Sea in the manner of the Thames sailing barge of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In the Netherlands a slightly different vessel did the same sort of work in similar waters. Before the development of steam engines, the passage of boats in places like the Thames estuary and the estuaries of the Netherlands, required the skillful use of tides as much as of the wind.\n\nHoys also would carry cargo or passengers to the larger ships anchored in the Thames. The British East India Company used hoys as lighters for larger ships that could not travel up the Thames to London. These were commonly referred to as East India hoys.\n\nIn the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, English hoys plied a trade between London and the north Kent coast that enabled middle class Londoners to escape the city for the more rural air of Margate, for example. Others sailed between London and Southampton. These were known as Margate or Southampton hoys and one could hail them from the shore to pick up goods and passengers.\n\nThe introduction of the early steamers greatly expanded this sort of trade. At the same time, barges were taking over the cargo coasting trade on the short routes. Together, these developments meant that hoys fell out of use.\n\nRoyal Navy\n\n \nThe British Royal Navy used hoys that were specially built to carry fresh water, gunpowder or ballast. Some were employed in such tasks as laying buoys or survey work, while others served to escort coastal convoys. Still others were in the Revenue service.\n\nIn 1793–94 the Royal Navy purchased 19 Dutch hoys as coastal gun-vessels, particularly for service under Admiral Sir Sidney Smith. In naval service these had 30-man crews and each carried one 24-pounder gun and three 32-pounder carronades. Examples include  and  (Sharks crew mutinied in 1795 and handed her over to the French). Around the end of the French Revolutionary Wars, the Navy sold its remaining armed hoys.\n\nConcern about a possible French invasion led the Royal Navy on 28 September 1804 to arm 16 hoys at Margate for the defense of the coast. One of these bore the name King George. The Navy manned each hoy with a captain and nine men from the Sea Fencibles.  The same concern also led the British to build over a hundred Martello towers along the British and Irish coasts.\n\nBecause most hoys were merchantmen, they were also frequently taken as prizes during time of war. Many of the hoys in British naval service had been captured from enemies. One of the earliest on record was the , captured in 1522 and listed until 1525.\nQuestion:\nA traditional hoy boat is powered by?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 3681, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 3681, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 6}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

The Ramphastidae family is most closely related to the American barbets. They are brightly marked and have large often-colorful bills. The family includes five genera and about forty different species. The name of this bird group is derived from the Tupi word  tukana, via Portuguese.  The family includes toucans, aracaris and toucanets; more distant relatives include various families of barbets and woodpeckers in the suborder Pici.\n\nMorphology\n\nToucans range in size from the lettered aracari (Pteroglossus inscriptus), at 130 g (4.6\xa0oz) and 29\xa0cm (11.5\xa0inches), to the toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), at 680 g (1.5\xa0lb) and 63\xa0cm (29\xa0inches). Their bodies are short (of comparable size to a crow\'s) and compact. The tail is rounded and varies in length, from half the length to the whole length of the body. The neck is short and thick. The wings are small, as they are forest-dwelling birds who only need to travel short distances, and are often of about the same span as the bill-tip-to-tail-tip measurements of the bird.\n\nThe legs of the toucan are strong and rather short. Their toes are arranged in pairs with the first and fourth toes turned backward. The majority of toucans do not show any sexual dimorphism in their coloration, the genus Selenidera being the most notable exception to this rule (hence their common name, ""dichromatic toucanets""). However, the bills of female toucans are usually shorter, deeper and sometimes straighter, giving more of a ""blocky"" impression compared to male bills. The feathers in the genus containing the largest toucans are generally black, with touches of white, yellow, and scarlet. The underparts of the araçaris (smaller toucans) are yellow, crossed by one or more black or red bands. The toucanets have mostly green plumage with blue markings.\n\nThe colorful and large bill, which in some large species measures more than half the length of the body, is the hallmark of toucans. Despite its size, the toucan\'s bill is very light, being composed of bone struts filled with spongy tissue of keratin  between them. The bill has forward-facing serrations resembling teeth, which historically led naturalists to believe that toucans captured fish and were primarily carnivorous; today it is known that they eat mostly fruit. Researchers have discovered that the large bill of the toucan is a highly efficient thermoregulation system, though its size may still be advantageous in other ways.   It does aid in their feeding behavior (as they sit in one spot and reach for all fruit in range, thereby reducing energy expenditure), and it has also been theorized that the bill may intimidate smaller birds, so that the toucan may plunder nests undisturbed (see Diet below). Also, the beak allows the bird to reach deep into tree-holes to access food unavailable to other birds, and also to ransack suspended nests built by smaller birds. However, as there is no sexual dimorphism in coloration it is unlikely to be a sexual signal.\n\nA toucan\'s tongue is long (up to 14–15\xa0cm, or 6\xa0inches), narrow, grey, and singularly frayed on each side, adding to its sensitivity as an organ of taste.\n\nA structural complex probably unique to toucans involves the modification of several tail vertebrae.  The rear three vertebrae are fused and attached to the spine by a ball and socket joint. Because of this, toucans may snap their tail forward until it touches the head.   This is the posture in which they sleep, often appearing simply as a ball of feathers, with the tip of the tail sticking out over the head.\n\nHabitat \n\nToucans are native to Southern Mexico, Central America, the northern part of South America, and the Caribbean region. They generally live in tropical and sub-tropical regions.\n\nToucans are arboreal and typically lay 2–21 white eggs in their nests. They make their nests in tree hollows and holes excavated by other animals such as woodpeckers—the toucan bill has very limited use as an excavation tool. When the eggs hatch, the young emerge completely naked, without any down.  Toucans are resident breeders and do not migrate. Toucans are usually found in pairs or small flocks.  They sometimes fence with their bills and wrestle, which scientists hypothesize they do to establish dominance hierarchies.\n\nDiet \n\nToucans are primarily frugivorous (fruit eating), but are opportunistically omnivorous and will take prey such as insects and small lizards.   Captive toucans have been reported to hunt insects actively in their cages, and it is possible to keep toucans on an insect-only diet. They also plunder nests of smaller birds, taking eggs and nestlings.Nadkarni, Nalini M. ; Wheelwright, Nathaniel T. (Editors). Monteverde: Ecology and Conservation of a Tropical Cloud Forest. Publisher: Oxford University Press, 2000. ISBN 978-0-19-513310-3  This probably provides a crucial addition of protein to their diet. Certainly, apart from being systematically predatory as well as frugivorous, like many omnivorous birds, they particularly prefer animal food for feeding their chicks.Short, Lester; Horne, Jennifer. Toucans, Barbets and Honeyguides. Publisher: Oxford University Press 2002.

Band-e-Amir is a chain of six lakes in the mountainous desert of central Afghanistan. The lakes formed from mineral-rich water that seeped out of faults and cracks in the rocky landscape. Over time, the water deposited layers of hardened mineral (travertine) that built up into walls that now contain the water. According to the Wildlife Conservation Society, who helped the Afghan government set up the park, Band-e-Amir is one of the few travertine systems in the world.They were created by the carbon dioxide rich water oozing out of the faults and fractures to deposit calcium carbonate precipitate in the form of travertine walls that today store the water of these lakes. Band-e Amir is one of the few rare natural lakes in the world which are created by travertine systems. The site of Band-e Amir has been described as Afghanistan\'s Grand Canyon, and draws thousands of tourists a year. The river is part of the system of the Balkh River.\n\nHistory\nThe name Band-e Amir literally means ""the Ruler\'s Dam"" which is believed by some to be a reference to Ali, the fourth Caliph of the Muslims. The area is dominated by ethnic Hazaras, who are estimated to make up about 40 percent of Afghanistan\'s population.In her 1970 guide to Afghanistan, Nancy Dupree wrote that a full description about Band-e Amir would ""rob the uninitiated of the wonder and amazement it produces on all who gaze upon it"". Parts of the 1975 Bollywood film Dharmatma, with Feroz Khan and Hema Malini, were filmed at the Band-e Amir National Park.In 2004, Band-e Amir was submitted for recognition as a World Heritage site. Efforts to make Band-e Amir a national park started in the 1970s, but were then put on hold due to the wars. In April 2009, Band-e Amir was finally declared Afghanistan\'s first national park. As of 2013, about 6,000 local tourists visit the Band-e Amir National Park every year. The area is protected by a small number of park rangers.\n\nGeography\nBand-e Amir is situated at approximately 75 km to the north-west of the ancient city of Bamyan, close to the town of Yakawlang. Together with Bamyan Valley, they are the heart of Afghanistan\'s tourism, attracting thousands of tourists every year and from every corner of the world. The Band-e Amir lakes are primarily a late spring and summertime tourism destination, as the high elevation central Hazarajat region of Afghanistan is extremely cold in winter, with temperatures reaching as low as −20 °C (−4.0 °F). The six constituent lakes of Band-e Amir are:\n\nBand-e Gholaman (Lake of the slaves)\nBand-e Qambar (Lake of Caliph Ali\'s slave)\nBand-e Haibat (Lake of grandiose)\nBand-e Panir (Lake of cheese)\nBand-e Pudina (Lake of wild mint)\nBand-e Zulfiqar (Lake of the sword of Ali)The white travertine dams created by fault lines, which are prevalent in the Band-e Amir Valley, form the barriers between the lakes. Band-e Haibat is the biggest and the deepest of the six, with an average depth of approximately 150 metres, as estimated by the Provincial Reconstruction Team diving team from New Zealand. Another comparable lake is Band-e Azhdahar (The Dragon), located a few kilometres southeast of the town of Bamyan, which has also been created as a result of carbon dioxide rich water oozing out of the faults underground and depositing calcium carbonate precipitate to form the travertine walls of Band-e Amir.\n\nClimate\nHigh in the Hindu Kush at approximately 2,900 metres (9,500 ft) above sea level, the national park has a subarctic climate (Dsc) closely bordering on a warm-summer humid continental climate (Dsb). The climate is extremely severe and the lakes freezing over in winter.\n\nCurrent status\nAfter the formal establishment of the park in 2009, a park office with a park warden and a group of rangers was installed to manage the conservation and protection of park natural resources. Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) is the only non-government organization with an office in the park. WCS supports park staff and works with the local community to promote conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. Ecotourism is expected to decrease local economic dependency on the park\'s natural resources. Tourists visit Band-e-Amir primarily in the summer months when the weather is warm. A poor local economy and limited outside investment have hampered efforts to attract winter tourism.\nThe local people in Band-e-Amir National Park rely heavily on the park\'s natural resources for their livelihood. Grazing of livestock, collection of shrubs for fuel and winter fodder and rain-fed farming is still widely practiced within the park boundary. Although the illegal hunting of birds and a few mammals living in the park is formally prohibited by the park office, there is no current data to evaluate the status of wildlife and biodiversity.\n\nImportant Bird Area\nA 41,000 ha tract overlapping the national park has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of Himalayan snowcocks, Hume\'s larks, white-winged snowfinches, Afghan snowfinches and Eurasian crimson-winged finches.\n\nSee also\nList of dams and reservoirs in Afghanistan\nNatural areas of Afghanistan\nWakhan National Park\nNuristan National Park\nPassage 2:\nQasim Oryakhail\nQasim Oryakhail (born 10 January 1992) is an Afghan cricketer.

In 1956 he was nominated for the Directors Guild of America award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Television, for his work directing a 1954 episode of Lassie.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 5:\nFolgore Division\nFolgore Division (Italian: Divisione Folgore) is a 1955 Italian war film directed by Duilio Coletti. It is based on actual events and depicts the 185th Airborne Division Folgore during the battle of El-Alamein. The screenwriter and military advisor was Marcantonio Bragadin.\n\nPlot\nIn the summer of 1942, during the Second World War, a group of young paratroopers from the Folgore Division, after having undergone a long and tiring training in Italy, was transported by air to the Libyan desert to cover the Italian-German front. The young soldiers believe that their destination is the island of Malta (operation C3) or the area of Alexandria: instead they find themselves thrown into a desert region where they are forced to live in holes dug in the sand and to face with insufficient means the armored British armored units. They will sadly see their parachutes piled up inside a warehouse in the desert. Thus develops that epic fight, which takes the name of the battle of El-Alamein, in which a handful of heroic fighters try with every effort to stop or at least delay the advance of General Montgomery\'s British tanks. Once their line-up has broken through, the survivors resist for several days an unequal struggle against the preponderant English forces, even being mentioned, for their heroism, by the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who called them ""The lions of the Thunderbolt"".\n\nCast\nEttore Manni: The Captain\nFausto Tozzi: The Sergeant\nJosé Jaspe: Salvi\nMarco Guglielmi: Lt.

He is the current Oceanian and Australian record holder in the 100 metres with a time of 9.93 seconds, which he achieved in Mito, Japan, on 5 May 2003. With that time he became the first person not of African ancestry to break the 10-second barrier (Frankie Fredericks, a Namibian, had been the first non-West-African in 1991). The time made him the 17th fastest man in history at the time and 38th man to crack the 10-second barrier. He was regarded as the fastest man of non-African descent before Christophe Lemaitre ran 9.92 seconds in French National Championships in Albi on 29 July 2011.He reached the finals in both the 100 and 200 metres at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, and the 200m final in the 2005 World Championships, where he finished 6th.  He represented Australia at the Olympic Games in 2000. He finished his career with one Commonwealth Games medal: a bronze in the 4 × 100 metres relay at the 2002 Commonwealth Games.\n\nPersonal life\nJohnson\'s mother was a Kaanju Indigenous Australian and his father is of Irish descent. He was born on a speed boat en route to Cairns base hospital. His mother died when he was young, so he grew up on his father\'s mackerel trawler, and spent his childhood travelling the coast of Cape York with his siblings. A chance entry into a 100m race in Queensland in his early 20s revealed his talent, and he later won a scholarship to attend the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra.

The stem is branched and is 1 millimetre (0.039 in) in diameter. It is also flexuous, striate, puberulent, and is grey to grey-black or grey-green in colour. The leaves are of the same colour, are glabrous and are 5–25 millimetres (0.20–0.98 in) long. Inflorescence is fascicled or racimed with pale pedicels that are 1–1.5 millimetres (0.039–0.059 in) long. Flowers have a pistillate and are staminate as well. Lobes are narrow-triangular, and are either white, pale yellow-green or just green in colour. Stigmas are obovoid trigonous and are 1.5 millimetres (0.059 in) long. They have white coloured and succulent tepals that are swollen also. The twigs are leafless.\n\nHabitat\nIt grows at elevations of 0–1,200 metres (0–3,937 ft) in coastal or subalpine climates. It can be found growing near rivers, on beaches, sand spits, and alluvial fans.\nPassage 5:\nEuptelea\nEuptelea is a genus of two species of flowering plants in the monogeneric family Eupteleaceae.  The genus is found from Assam east through China to Japan, and consists of shrubs or small trees:\n\nEuptelea pleiosperma\nEuptelea polyandraThe genus was previously placed in the family Trochodendraceae, but the family Eupteleaceae has been recognized by many taxonomists. The APG IV system (2016; unchanged from the APG III system of 2009, the APG II system of 2003 and the APG system of 1998), recognizes it and places it in the order Ranunculales, in the clade eudicots. The family consists of a single genus Euptelea, with two species, native to eastern Asia.\nEuptelea polyandra is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the engrailed.\nThe flowers lack sepals and petals. The anthers are basifixed, and the leaves are arranged in whorls.The fossil range of the genus extends back to the Paleocene epoch, during much of the Cenozoic it was distributed widely over the Northern Hemisphere.\nPassage 6:\nMuehlenbeckia australis\nMuehlenbeckia australis, the large-leaved muehlenbeckia or pohuehue, is a prostrate or climbing plant native to New Zealand.\n\nDescription\nThe species grows up to 10 metres (33 ft) tall with grey bark. The leaves are on stiff petioles and are 25 millimetres (0.98 in) long. Lamina is 2–8 centimetres (0.79–3.15 in) by 1–3 centimetres (0.39–1.18 in) long.\nIt has juvenile and adult leaf forms and loses its leaves in winter. The flowers are greenish and the fruits are juicy with black shiny seeds covered by a white, succulent cup of sepals, which are fed on by various birds and lizards.\nFlowers bloom from late spring to autumn, with it panicles occur usually in spring and summer. Fruits are present from November to April, sometimes till June.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe species was first described in 1786 by Georg Forster, as Coccoloba australis. It was transferred to the genus Muehlenbeckia in 1841 by Carl Meissner. Some sources, including Plants of the World Online, regard Muehlenbeckia adpressa as a synonym of this species. Others treat them as separate species.\n\nEcology\nM. australis prefers places with plenty of sunlight and climbing support, such as forest edges, cliff faces, scrub and regenerating vegetation. With its climbing and rapid growth form, it is capable of engulfing roadside trees, and has benefited from cleared habitats created since human settlement began, and is sometimes the only native species present in such areas.\n\nHost plant\nM. australis is a host plant for numerous New Zealand endemic insects including Pyrgotis eudorana, Apoctena orthropis, Argosarchus horridus, and Clitarchus hookeri.\nPassage 7:\nMuehlenbeckia horrida subsp. abdita\nMuehlenbeckia horrida subsp. abdita (syn. Duma horrida subsp. abdita). commonly known as remote thorny lignum, is a critically endangered shrub endemic to Western Australia.\n\nDescription\nIt is an upright, spreading, leafless shrub, that grows to a height of from 60 to 120 centimetres. It has bright, light yellow clusters of flowers.\nThe subspecies was described in 1996 by Karen Wilson.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nMuehlenbckia horrida subsp. abdita is known only from two populations within the Lake Bryde-East Lake Bryde wetland, in the Western Mallee subregion of the Mallee region in the South West Botanical Province of Western Australia.\nIt grows in waterlogged silt and sand, on the beds of Lake Bryde and East Lake Bryde. It depends for its survival upon a regular cycle of freshwater flooding followed by drying of the lake bed.\n\nConservation\nPopulations of M. h. subsp. abdita have declined severely in the last thirty years, mainly because of increasing salinity. Salinity loads in the Lakes were measured at around 160 tonnes in 1985, but had increased to around 1200 tonnes in 2005. This increase is attributable to a rising water table caused by widespread clearing for agriculture. Other threats include interruption of the flooding/drying regime because of altered hydrology; and recreational activities such as water skiing. It is estimated that there are about 2000 plants left. There was previously a third population, but these were all dead in 2002, and the population is thought to be unrecoverable.It is listed as ""critically endangered"" under Australia\'s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and as ""Rare"" under Western Australia\'s Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. The whole lake bed ecosystem has been classified as a critically endangered threatened ecological community under the name Bryde.\nPassage 8:\nMuehlenbeckia adpressa\nMuehlenbeckia adpressa, commonly known as climbing lignum, is a prostrate or climbing plant, native to Australia. It has thin red-brown stems up to 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) in length. The leaves are 1.5–6 centimetres (0.59–2.36 in) long and 1.5–3.5 centimetres (0.59–1.38 in) wide. It occurs in coastal areas of Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe species was first described in 1805 by Jacques Labillardière, as Polygonum adpressum. It was transferred to the genus Muehlenbeckia in 1843 by Carl Meissner. Some sources, including Plants of the World Online, regard M. adpressa as a synonym of M. australis. Others treat them as separate species.\n\nGallery\nPassage 9:\nMuehlenbeckia\nMuehlenbeckia or maidenhair is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the borders of the Pacific, including South and North America, Papua New Guinea and Australasia. It has been introduced elsewhere, including Europe. Species vary in their growth habits, many being vines or shrubs. In some environments, rampant species can become weedy and difficult to eradicate.\n\nDescription\nSpecies of Muehlenbeckia vary considerably in their growth habits; they may be perennials, vinelike, or shrubs. All have rhizomatous roots. Their leaves are arranged alternately on the stem, usually with stalks (petioles), but sometimes stalkless (sessile). The brownish ocrea is short and tubular, soon disintegrating. The inflorescences may be terminal or axillary, and are in the form of spikes or clusters, with at most very short peduncles (flowering stems). Individual flowers have pedicels (stalks). The flowers may be bisexual or unisexual, with sometimes a mixture of staminate, pistillate and bisexual flowers on the same plant. There are five white to greenish white tepals, joined at the base. Staminate flowers have 8 (sometimes 9) stamens and a rudimentary pistil. Pistillate flowers have rudimentary stamens and three spreading styles. The fruit is in the form of a black or dark brown unwinged achene, three-sided to more or less globe-shaped, at least partly enclosed by the persistent tepals.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe genus was erected by Carl Meissner in 1841, initially for two species that he distinguished from Coccoloba and Polygonum. The generic name honours Alsatian bryologist Heinrich Gustav Mühlenbeck (1798–1845).Muehlenbeckia is placed in the tribe Polygoneae of the subfamily Polygonoideae. Within the tribe, it is most closely related to the genera Reynoutria and Fallopia s.s., forming the so-called ""RMF clade"".\n\nSpecies\nAs of March 2019, Plants of the World Online recognized 24 species (see note below):\n\nSome sources, including Plants of the World Online, regard M. adpressa as a synonym of M. australis. Others treat them as separate species.Three species have been transferred to the genus Duma:\nMuehlenbeckia coccoloboides J.M.Black → Duma coccoloboides\nMuehlenbeckia florulenta Meisn. – tangled lignum → Duma florulenta\nMuehlenbeckia horrida H.Gross → Duma horrida\n\nDistribution\nNative\n\nAustralasia:\nAustralia: Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Norfolk Island, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia\nNew Zealand: Chatham Islands, New Zealand North, New Zealand South\nPapuasia: New Guinea\nNeotropic:\nCentral America: Honduras\nSouthern South America: Chile\n\nInvasiveness\nAll members of the RMF clade appear to have the potential to become invasive, in some cases via vigorous hybrids. The highly invasive Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica) hybridizes with Muehlenbeckia australis. The related Muehlenbeckia complexa has established populations in southern parts of Britain and in the Channel Islands, and is a problematic invasive species in the San Francisco area.\nPassage 10:\nMuehlenbeckia axillaris\nMuehlenbeckia axillaris (creeping wire vine, sprawling wire vine, matted lignum) is a low evergreen shrub, forming wiry mats up to about 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) in diameter, native to New Zealand, and the Australian states of Tasmania, New South Wales and Victoria. It has thin, red-brown stems, with glossy squarish to roundish leaves that are less than 1 cm (0.39 in) in diameter and 2–4 mm (0.079–0.157 in) thick. Flowers are inconspicuous, yellowish-white, 4–8 mm (0.16–0.31 in) in diameter, and borne in groups of up to three in the axils. The fruit is black, shiny, and up to 3.5 mm (0.14 in) long, produced in late summer to fall.\nThe plant is hardy, drought-tolerant, and quick-growing, thriving in a range of light conditions. It can be cultivated as a ground cover and grows well in rocky ground, as well as standard potting soil. Although it grows fastest in warm seasons, it tolerates freezing weather.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe species was first described by Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1847, who used the name ""Polygonum (Muhlenbeckia) axillaris"". Both Stephan Endlicher (in 1848) and Wilhelm Gerhard Walpers (in 1849) later referred to it as just Muehlenbeckia axillaris.\n\nSynonyms\nPseudanthus tasmanicus\n```\n\nQuestion: Are Euptelea and Muehlenbeckia both genuses?\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 3655, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 3655, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 6}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

The attack, in the heavily fortified Green Zone of Baghdad, occurred ten minutes after the Council of Representatives had adjourned for lunch. It was on the first floor of the Baghdad Convention Center, which houses the parliament. Two further unexploded suicide vests were found near the canteen. The building had earlier been searched by dogs – very rare considering dogs are considered ritually unclean by Iraqis – suggesting the authorities suspected an attack was imminent. Following the attack the government closed down mobile phone networks and Apache helicopters flew overhead.\n\nCasualties\nThe US military reported on 13 April that only MP Mohammed Awad had died, and that 22 others were wounded.Early reports however had said that eight people were killed, including three MPs, and at least 23 people were reported wounded. The MPs named were Mohammed Awad, a member of the Iraqi National Dialogue Front, Taha al-Liheibi, a member of the Iraqi Accordance Front and an unnamed Kurdish MP.\n\nResponsibility\nSuspicions initially centered on the bomber having been the bodyguard of an MP. A government spokesman said ""there are some groups that work in politics during the day and do things other than politics at night"". Member of Parliament Mohammed al-Dayni accused the government of lax security at the site.On 13 April, the Islamic State of Iraq posted a message on an Islamist website claiming to have sent ""A knight from the state of Islam ... [into] the heart of the Green Zone"" to carry out the attack. It is not clear whether this claim is genuine, though some who monitor such websites believe it is.In February 2009, two bodyguards of Iraqi National Dialogue Front MP Mohammed al-Dayni were arrested on suspicion of the attacks. Alaa Khairallah Hashim, al-Dayni\'s security chief and Ryadh Ibrahim al-Dayni, Mohammed al-Dayni\'s nephew, confessed on television to involvement in several attacks, including the parliament bombing. They said the MP had given authorisation for the bomber to enter the parliament area. The security forces asked the Council of Representatives of Iraq to lift al-Dayni\'s parliamentary immunity. Mohammed al-Dayni claimed that the accusations were lies and that his bodyguards had been tortured into making a false confession because he had been disclosing human rights abuses in Iraqi prisons. al-Dayni took a flight to Jordan, but the aeroplane was forced to turn back; parliament then agreed to lift his immunity.\n\nReactions\nWhen the bombing occurred, Saleh al-Mutlaq, the head of oppositional Iraqi National Dialogue Front, the party of the killed MP Awad, called on the United States to overthrow the government of Nouri al-Maliki: ""We need America to realize that this pro-Iranian government it has installed has allowed interference on the side of one against the other"".The Iraqi Council of Representatives held an emergency assembly the following day in response to the bombing, to ""show resilience in the face of such attacks"".US President George W. Bush condemned the attacks, saying ""there is an enemy willing to bomb innocent people and a symbol of democracy"". The Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammad Ali Hosseini described the attack as ""inhumane and satanic ... target[ting] both its Shia and Sunni officials""Four days later three Ministers from the Sadrist Movement quit the government, citing, among other things, the growing insecurity in Baghdad.\n\nSee also\n2007 suicide bombings in Iraq\nList of attacks on legislatures\nPassage 10:\nAnant Nag filmography\nAnant Nag is an Indian actor and occasional film producer who appears as an actor in predominantly in Kannada films and a few Hindi and Telugu films.

He is the younger brother of footballer Goran Švonja.\n\nClub career\nFrom 2016 to 2018, he played for OFK Bačka.\nPassage 2:\nAnton Shunto\nAnton Shunto (Belarusian: Антон Шунто; Russian: Антон Шунто; born 31 May 1988) is a Belarusian professional footballer who plays for Zhodino-Yuzhnoye.He is a younger brother of Denis Shunto, who is a founder and former president of Krumkachy Minsk.\n\nCareer\nShunto started his career with FC Krumkachy Minsk.\nPassage 3:\nPeter Rosegger\nPeter Rosegger (original Roßegger) (31 July 1843 – 26 June 1918) was an Austrian writer and poet from Krieglach in the province of Styria. He was a son of a mountain farmer and grew up in the woodlands and mountains of Alpl. Rosegger (or Rossegger) went on to become a most prolific poet and author as well as an insightful teacher and visionary.\nIn his later years, he was honoured by officials from various Austrian universities and the city of Graz (the capital of Styria). He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature three times. He was nearly awarded the Nobel Prize in 1913 and is (at least among the people of Styria) something like a national treasure to this day.\n\nEarly life\nRosegger was born as the first of seven children of a peasant couple in the village of Alpl, in the mountains above Krieglach, Styria. The family lived in a simple 18th-century Alpine farmhouse, called Kluppeneggerhof. Living conditions were modest, the central room was used for eating, sleeping and working. Food was prepared over a hearth in the scullery. The farmhouse is now part of the Universalmuseum Joanneum, but even today the building ensemble can only be reached by foot.\nSince this little village, consisting only of a handful of farms, had neither a church nor a school, Rosegger and the other children would have had to walk down the mountain to the larger village, St. Kathrein, in order to attend either. The way there takes two hours and as a result, Peter had very limited education, largely provided by a wandering teacher who taught him and other children from the region for a year and a half. His physical constitution was not sufficient for him to become a farmer like his father, as he was often sick and rather frail in general. So, he became understudy of a traveling tailor at the age of seventeen.\n\nSuccess as a writer\nHis interest in literature prevailed, although he earned little money. He spent what he could afford on books and soon began to write himself. Eventually, he was discovered by the publisher of the Graz-based newspaper, Tagespost, published by Dr. Svoboda. He realized Rosegger\'s talent as an author and enabled him to attend the Akademie für Handel und Industrie (Academy for Trade and Industries) in Graz.\nThere, Peter von Reininghaus became his mentor. Von Reininghaus was a wealthy and influential industrialist, and Rosegger had a personal friendship with him for the rest of his life. However, he had a hard time studying, as he was not used to attending school regularly, and had little, and fragmentary, knowledge in many disciplines. He left the academy in 1869 at the age of twenty-six.\nSoon after that, he was offered a chance to publish his literary works, namely by Gustav Heckenast, who had worked with Adalbert Stifter before. Peter Rosegger accepted, and his first book, Geschichten aus der Steiermark (""Tales from Styria""), was released in 1871. From then on, all of his works were published by Heckenast. [Presumably only until Heckenast\'s death: see next sentence?]\nRosegger changed to a new publisher twice after Heckenast\'s death, eventually ending up with Ludwig Staackmann, who made him a most generous offer. He had always been very faithful towards his publishers, and the relationship between them was one of friendship and familiarity. Rosegger started to publish Heimgarten in 1876, a monthly journal with articles and stories for the people of the country, whose main representative and interpreter he was.\n\nCharacter and private life\nIn 1873, Rosegger married Anna Pichler. They had two children, but the marriage was short - Anna died giving birth in 1875. This affected Peter to a great degree, as is obvious from various letters he wrote to friends in that time. In 1879, Rosegger married again: Anna Knaur, with whom he had three more children and a very harmonious house life. She also cared for him during his many times of sickness.\nHe developed many brilliant and extraordinary ideas from the context of his time, and kept contact with unconventional personalities. Rudolf Falb, the creator of the popular ""lunisolar flood theory,"" was not only his school teacher but remained a lifelong friend. Although feeling strongly connected to his rural homelands, he was a liberal thinker with conservative roots. Fascinated by machines and technology, and being a faithful Christian, he showed a sharp eye for the potentials and advantages, as well as for the dangers and downsides of both the church and the economic development of the late 19th century. As an author he aimed to entertain, to teach and also to help. He called for donations publicly at various occasions or used his influence in academic circles, thus contributing to the founding of one school (in Alpl, his home village), the building of two churches (one in Mürzzuschlag and one in St. Kathrein, rebuilt after it burned down) and other benevolent actions.\n\nHonors\nIn 1903, at his 60th birthday, he was honoured by receiving the ""Ehrendoktorwürde"" (Doctor honoris causa) of the University of Heidelberg. The University of Vienna and the University of Graz also awarded him with similar decorations, and the German emperor Wilhelm II, as well as the Austrian emperor Franz Josef I of Austria gave Rosegger medals of honour (namely, the ""Kronenorden 2. Klasse"" and the ""Ehrenabzeichen für Kunst und Wissenschaft""). He became citizen of honour in Graz and Vienna, and Franz Josef\'s successor Karl presented the ex-farmer-boy-now-national-poet with the Franz-Joseph-medal, a high-ranking accolade for an author.\n\nLate life and death\nRosegger, who had been ill frequently and seriously, travelled back to his home in Krieglach in May 1918 in order to die where ""the beautiful legend of the forest-farmer boy"" had once begun, in the woodlands of the Styrian Alps.\nHis birth house, the former ""Forest School"" (Waldschule) he helped to found in Alpl in 1902 and his house in Krieglach, where he lived until his death in 1918, are museums today. The region where he came from (the mountains of the Fischbacher Alps south of Krieglach and Mürzzuschlag) are now unofficially named ""Waldheimat"" (""Home in the Forest"") after the name he gave it himself. The tourism industry in the region still profits from Rosegger\'s enduring popularity among readers.\n\nSelected works\nZither und Hackbrett (poems in Styrian dialect, 1870)\nVolksleben in Steiermark (""People\'s Life in Styria""), 1875\nDie Schriften des Waldschulmeisters (""Manuscripts of a Forest-school Master""), 1875\nWaldheimat (""Home in the Forest""), 1877\nDer Gottsucher (""the God-seeker""), 1883\nHeidepeters Gabriel, 1886\nJakob der Letzte (""Jakob the Last One""), 1888\nAls ich noch jung war (""When I Was Young""), 1895\nDas ewige Licht (""the Eternal Light""), 1896\nErdsegen (""Earth\'s Blessing""), 1900\nAls ich noch der Waldbauernbub war (""When I Was a Forest-farmer Boy""), 1902\n\nFurther reading\nEindringen des Kapitalismus in ein Bauerndorf, Martin der Mann, 1889 (""Introduction of Capitalism into a Village of Farmers"", ""Martin the Man"")\nHoch vom Dachstein, 1891\nWeltgift, 1903\nINRI (Christ book), 1905\nCollected Works, 1913–16\nLetters to F. v.

Here he also made religious profession, first as a teacher and later as prior. He first held the office of precentor of the Diocese of Norwich from about 1136, and was subsequently Prior of Norwich.Turbeville was present at the Easter synod of 1144 when Godwin Stuart alleged that his nephew, William of Norwich, a boy of about twelve years, had been murdered by the Norwich Jews during the preceding Holy Week.\nWhen Turbeville became bishop in 1146 or early 1147 he propagated the cult of the ""boy-martyr"". On four occasions he had the boy\'s remains transferred to more honourable places, and in 1168 erected a chapel in his honour in Mousehold Wood, where the boy\'s body was said to have been found. He persuaded Thomas of Monmouth, a monk of Norwich priory, to write ""The Life and Miracles of St William of Norwich"" about 1173, the only extant authority for the legend of William, which is now commonly discredited.\nTurbeville attended the Council of Rheims in 1148.Turbeville died on 16 January 1174 or 17 January 1174.\n\nCitations\nPassage 2:\nWilliam Scott, Lord Balwearie\nSir William Scott, Lord Balwearie (died 1532), or William Scot, was a Scottish judge.\n\nBiography\nScott was elder son of Sir William Scott of Balwearie, by Isobel, daughter of Sir John Moncrieff of Moncrieff. He accompanied James IV in his expedition into England in 1513, and, being taken prisoner at the battle of Flodden, was obliged to sell a portion of his lands of Strathmiglo to purchase his ransom. In February 1524 he was chosen a commissioner to parliament, when he was appointed one of the lords of the articles for the barons, an honour frequently afterwards conferred on him, although obtained by no one else under the rank of a peer. On 24 November he was styled a justice, in the absence of the justice-general, in a commission appointed to do justice on the ""malt makers of Leith for common oppression through the exorbitant dearth raised by them, and of their causing through the whole realm"". On the institution of the college of justice on 13 May 1532, he was nominated the first justice on the temporal side, but died before 19 November of the same year. \nBy his wife, Janet Lundy, daughter of Thomas Lundy of Lundy, he had two sons, Sir William, father of Sir James Scott (fl. 1579–1606), and Thomas (1480?–1539).\nPassage 3:\nErich Haenisch\nErich Haenisch  (27 August 1880, Berlin – 21 December 1966, Stuttgart)  was a German sinologist and first-degree cousin of politician Konrad Haenisch. He was the academic teacher of George Kennedy (Yale).\nDuring World War II., Haenisch was the only German sinologist who actively intervened with the Nazi government on behalf of his colleague Henri Maspero, who had been arrested by the Gestapo and taken to Buchenwald, since his son was a member of the resistance. Since Haenisch did not receive support by his German colleagues, he could not save Maspero, who died in Buchenwald on March 17, 1945.\n\nExternal links\nErich Haenisch: Sinological Profiles, University of Massachusetts\nLiterature by and about Erich Haenisch in the German National Library catalogue\nPassage 4:\nWilliam Lamb alias Paniter\nWilliam Lamb, or William Paniter alias Lamb, (c. 1493 - 1550) was a Scottish cleric, lawyer, and author.\n\nLife\nWilliam Lamb was the son of a sister of Patrick Paniter, and a cousin of David Panter. In his early career he adopted his uncle Patrick Paniter\'s name. His clerical appointments included the Prebendaries of Conveth and Croy, rectory of Kinnell, and canon of Moray. He was enrolled as Master of Arts at St Andrews University in 1520.\nOn 25 February 1537, James V of Scotland ordered the Court of Session to admit William to sit in daily at their proceedings to learn their legal practices. He became a Senator of the College of Justice.\n\nAne Resonyng\nWilliam Lamb wrote Ane Resonyng of ane Scottis and Inglis merchand betuix Rowand and Lionis in 1549. It was an answer to English propaganda published during the war of the Rough Wooing. Unlike the Complaynt of Scotland (Paris, 1549), Lamb\'s book was not published but survived in manuscript.\nThe arguments are set out as a dialogue between a Scot and an Englishmen who meet while travelling in France, with an appearance from Thomas More, John Fisher and Richard Reynolds of Sion, three English Catholic martyrs.\n\nFootnotes\n\nLyall, Roderick J, ed., William Lamb - ""Ane Resonyng"" (Aberdeen University Press, 1985).\nPassage 5:\nWilliam Pooley\nSir William Pooley (died 5 August 1629) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1621 and 1629.\nPooley was of Boxted, Suffolk and was knighted by James I. In 1621, he was elected Member of Parliament for Preston. He was elected MP for both Preston and Sudbury in 1624 and chose to sit for Sudbury. In 1626 he was elected MP for Wigan. He was elected MP for Sudbury again in 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament, and then did so for eleven years.His daughter Judith married Sir Humphrey May.\nPassage 6:\nWilliam of March\nWilliam of March (or William March; died 1302) was a medieval Treasurer of England and a Bishop of Bath and Wells.\n\nLife\nWilliam was always referred to as magister, and may have attended and graduated from Oxford University. He was controller of the wardrobe from 1283 to 1290 and Dean of St. Martin\'s-le-Grand before being selected as Treasurer in August 1290. He was Treasurer until he was dismissed in August 1295. While treasurer, he introduced the practice of keeping Exchequer Journal rolls, or as accountants know them day books, which recorded the total amount in the treasury at the start of each day along with all payments made that day. This practice began in 1293, and did not record any payments made before taxes arrived at the treasury.William was a canon of Wells by 20 March 1291 and a royal clerk.William was elected bishop on 30 January 1293 and consecrated on 17 May 1293. As treasurer he was instrumental in putting forward administrative changes in the way the department was run. For the first time, monies coming into the treasury were recorded on special accounts and the officials of the department became more involved in the collection and assessment of taxes and other varieties of income. However, in August 1295 William was dismissed as treasurer, although the financial policies did not change. It may be that King Edward I used March as a scapegoat, or it may be that some charges that citizens of London brought against the treasurer were felt to be valid. After his dismissal from the treasurership in 1295, he devoted himself to the care of his diocese, and was regarded as a pious bishop.William died on 11 June 1302 although current historical research is challenging that date. He was buried at Wells Cathedral in the south transept wall on 17 June 1302. In 1325 there was a petition for him to be canonized, which continued to be supported by kings Edward II and Edward III. William is supposed to have built the chapter house at Wells. His will named a brother, John March, and a nephew, Robert Urry, to whom William left monies to go on crusade in William\'s name.\n\nCitations\nPassage 7:\nWilliam Middleton (bishop)\nWilliam Middleton (or William de Middleton; died 31 August or 1 September 1288) was a medieval Bishop of Norwich.\n\nLife\nMiddleton began his career as a clerk in the Jewish exchequer in 1265. He was given custody of the rolls in 1276, and in 1277 was at the French royal court. He was an official of Canterbury when he was appointed Archdeacon of Canterbury by Archbishop Robert Kilwardby in October 1275. He may also have held a prebend in the diocese of London.Middleton was elected on 24 February 1278 and was consecrated on 29 May 1278. He was enthroned at Norwich Cathedral on 27 November 1278. He continued to work on royal administrative business after his election and consecration.In July 1287 Middleton was appointed to the offices of Seneschal of Gascony and Lieutenant of the Duchy of Aquitaine. He died 31 August or 1 September 1288.\n\nCitations\nPassage 8:\nWilliam of St. Barbara\nWilliam of St. Barbara or William of Ste Barbe (died 1152) was a medieval Bishop of Durham.\n\nLife\nFrom William\'s name, it is presumed that he was a native of Sainte-Barbe-en-Auge in Calvados in Normandy (Neustria). He was a canon of York Minster in 1128. He was Dean of York by December 1138.William was elected to the see of Durham on 14 March 1143 and consecrated on 20 June 1143. He was elected in opposition to William Cumin who had been intruded into the see by King David I of Scotland in 1141. Cumin was never consecrated and by 1143 had been excommunicated by Pope Innocent II who also ordered a new election to be held at York Minster. It was this election which selected William of St. Barbara. However, the new bishop was not able to enter Durham right away, and he was enthroned either on 18 October 1144 or shortly thereafter.Troubles continued in Durham, and the bishop was unable to attend the Council of Rheims in 1148, which led to a suspension by the pope for inattendance. William supported Henry Murdac in the disputed election to the archbishopric of York, and it was probably Murdac who arranged for the suspension to be lifted. William also supported the Cistercians and the Augustinians, which perturbed  his cathedral chapter which was made up of Benedictine monks. He died 13 November 1152. A grave identified as his was excavated in the 19th century in the chapter house of  Durham Cathedral.\n\nCitations\nPassage 9:\nW. Langdon Kihn\nWilfred (or William) Langdon Kihn (September 5, 1898 – December 12, 1957) was a portrait painter and illustrator specializing in portraits of American Indians.\n\nLife and career\nHe was born in Brooklyn, New York, son of Alfred Charles Kihn and Carrie Lowe (Peck) Kihn.  He attended Boys\' High School in Brooklyn and was recognized there for his artistic talent.He married Helen Van Tine Butler in 1920, and lived in Hadlyme and Moodus, Connecticut.He studied with the Art Students League, 1916–17, and was a pupil of Homer Boss and Winold Reiss.\n\nMotivated by a desire to document the disappearing aboriginal culture, he spent many years visiting and living with Indian tribes in the Western United States.  In 1920, he was admitted to the Blackfeet tribe in Montana, under the name ""Zoi-och-ka-tsai-ya,"" meaning ""Chase Enemy in Water"".In 1922, the New York Times described his work as follows:\n\nMr. Kihn\'s portraits are marvels of incisive characterization. These closely studied physiognomies show no trace of the sentimental idealization from which most painters of Indian subjects find it almost impossible to escape. Each is firm, clear, and direct, recording the subtle differences of aspect difficult enough to discern in races other than our own, and seizing the essential message of the face with youthful certainty and conviction.\nThroughout his career, he also illustrated a number of books, including Indian Days in the Canadian Rockies by Marius Barbeau (1923) and Pocahontas and Her World by Frances Carpenter (1961). Many of his illustrations featured colorful portraits, while children\'s story books such as Flat Tail by Alice Gall and Fleming Crew (1935) often featured line drawings.\nAlong with writer Donald Barr Chidsey, he was a Democratic candidate for the Connecticut House of Representatives from the town of Lyme, in the November 2, 1948 election.He died in Lawrence Memorial Hospital, New London, Connecticut, after a short illness, and was buried in Cove Cemetery, Hadlyme, Connecticut.\n\nCollections and exhibitions\nHis paintings were featured in one-man and group exhibitions in many different museums and galleries, starting in the early 1920s.His work is in the permanent collections of, among others, the McCord Museum in Montreal, Quebec, and the Davison Art Center Gallery at Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut.In 2014, the Foosaner Art Museum at the Florida Institute of Technology hosted an exhibition of his works, featuring pictures from the Vancouver Art Gallery and the National Geographic Society and a private collector.\n\nSee also\nNative Americans in the United States: Depictions by Europeans and Americans\nNative Americans in popular culture\nElbridge Ayer Burbank\nGeorge Catlin\nSeth and Mary Eastman\nPaul Kane\nCharles Bird King\nJoseph Henry Sharp\nJohn Mix Stanley\n\nSources\nExternal links\n\nW.

It is the place of death of Jacques MacDonald, a French general who served in the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nPopulation\nSee also\nCommunes of the Loiret department\nPassage 3:\nPlace of birth\nThe place of birth (POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. Practice regarding whether this place should be a country, a territory or a city/town/locality differs in different countries, but often city or territory is used for native-born citizen passports and countries for foreign-born ones.\nAs a general rule with respect to passports, if the place of birth is to be a country, it\'s determined to be the country that currently has sovereignty over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\nSome countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of födelsehemort (""domicile of birth"") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby\'s mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\nSimilarly, Switzerland uses the concept of place of origin. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother\'s or father\'s place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder\'s place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In Japan, the registered domicile is a similar concept.\nIn some countries (primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase jus soli. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality(-ies) of the baby\'s parents (referred to as jus sanguinis).\nThere can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality(-ies) of the parents and/or the location of the plane or ship (if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\nSome administrative forms may request the applicant\'s ""country of birth"". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant\'s ""place of birth"" or ""nationality at birth"". For example, US citizens born abroad who acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA (American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nReference list\n8 FAM 403.4 Place of Birth\nPassage 4:\nSennedjem\nSennedjem was an Ancient Egyptian artisan who was active during the reigns of Seti I and Ramesses II.

He graduated in January 1827.\n\nCareer and personal life\nIn around 1830, the London Missionary Society dispatched Handt to work with natives in Australia, alongside a few other Germans. Handt reached Sydney on 25 June 1831. That year, he travelled with his wife to Wellington, New South Wales, to start missionary work for the New South Wales Church Mission Society.

He had his first lessons on the oboe from his father, a skilled player of the violin and oboe. After the premature death of his father, he spent a period of self-tuition before moving to Berlin where he immediately sought lessons with the royal Kammermusicus and famous oboe virtuoso Peter Glösch. In 1746, he was accepted into the Hofkapelle of Frederick the Great and, at this time, began studying composition with his colleague, the flautist Friedrich Wilhelm Riedt.By 1754, Jacobi was employed as the principal oboist in the Hofkapelle of Frederick the Great\'s cousin, Charles Frederick Albert, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt in Berlin. On the recommendation of Johann Joachim Quantz, in 1768 King Frederick appointed Jacobi as the director of the Hautboistenschule in Potsdam, responsible for training the nearly 2,000 oboists in the Prussian army.Jacobi was a member of the ""Freitagsakademien"" (Friday academies), a musical society which met each Friday at the house of Johann Gottlieb Janitsch. For Jacobi, Janitsch was said to have composed all manner of trios, quartets and concertos in ""all the usual and unusual keys"". Such pieces allowed Jacobi to improve his skills as an oboist, and earned him a great reputation amongst Berlin\'s musical societies. Two works  by Janitsch bear a dedication to Jacobi, and several other works in extremely uncharacteristic keys for the oboe by Janitsch can be presumed to have been composed for him. They are a testament to his great skill on the instrument. Bruce Haynes lists him among the great oboists of the baroque period.Unfortunately, no compositions by Jacobi have survived.\nPassage 9:\nJohann Gottlieb Kugelann\nJohann Gottlieb Kugelann (2 January 1753 – 8 September 1815) was a German entomologist.

It is found in China, India, and Myanmar.\nPassage 2:\nPeristoreus viridipennis\nPeristoreus viridipennis is a species of true weevil. It is endemic to New Zealand. It is associated with plants of the genus Muehlenbeckia.P. viridipennis was originally named Erirhinus viridipennis by Broun in 1880. Then, in 1926, Marshall described a new genus called Dorytomodes, into which he provisionally transferred all species placed by Broun in Erirrhinus [=Erirhinus]. Dorytomodes was subsequently sunk as a synonym of Peristoreus by Edwin S. (""Ted"") Gourlay in 1950.\nPassage 3:\nPeristoreus fulvus\nPeristoreus fulvus is a species of true weevil. It is endemic to New Zealand. It is associated with plants of the genus Muehlenbeckia.P. fulvus was originally named Erirhinus fulvus by Broun in 1886. Then, in 1926, Marshall described a new genus called Dorytomodes, into which he provisionally transferred all species placed by Broun in Erirrhinus [=Erirhinus]. Dorytomodes was subsequently sunk as a synonym of Peristoreus by Edward S. (""Ted"") Gourlay in 1950.\nPassage 4:\nMuehlenbeckia ephedroides\nMuehlenbeckia ephedroides, the leafless pohuehue or leafless muehlenbeckia, is a prostrate or climbing plant native to New Zealand.\n\nDescription\nMuehlenbeckia ephedroides are grey-green, grey to grey-black in colour. The stem is branched and is 1 millimetre (0.039 in) in diameter. It is also flexuous, striate, puberulent, and is grey to grey-black or grey-green in colour. The leaves are of the same colour, are glabrous and are 5–25 millimetres (0.20–0.98 in) long. Inflorescence is fascicled or racimed with pale pedicels that are 1–1.5 millimetres (0.039–0.059 in) long. Flowers have a pistillate and are staminate as well. Lobes are narrow-triangular, and are either white, pale yellow-green or just green in colour. Stigmas are obovoid trigonous and are 1.5 millimetres (0.059 in) long. They have white coloured and succulent tepals that are swollen also. The twigs are leafless.\n\nHabitat\nIt grows at elevations of 0–1,200 metres (0–3,937 ft) in coastal or subalpine climates. It can be found growing near rivers, on beaches, sand spits, and alluvial fans.\nPassage 5:\nEuptelea\nEuptelea is a genus of two species of flowering plants in the monogeneric family Eupteleaceae.  The genus is found from Assam east through China to Japan, and consists of shrubs or small trees:\n\nEuptelea pleiosperma\nEuptelea polyandraThe genus was previously placed in the family Trochodendraceae, but the family Eupteleaceae has been recognized by many taxonomists. The APG IV system (2016; unchanged from the APG III system of 2009, the APG II system of 2003 and the APG system of 1998), recognizes it and places it in the order Ranunculales, in the clade eudicots. The family consists of a single genus Euptelea, with two species, native to eastern Asia.\nEuptelea polyandra is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the engrailed.\nThe flowers lack sepals and petals. The anthers are basifixed, and the leaves are arranged in whorls.The fossil range of the genus extends back to the Paleocene epoch, during much of the Cenozoic it was distributed widely over the Northern Hemisphere.\nPassage 6:\nMuehlenbeckia australis\nMuehlenbeckia australis, the large-leaved muehlenbeckia or pohuehue, is a prostrate or climbing plant native to New Zealand.\n\nDescription\nThe species grows up to 10 metres (33 ft) tall with grey bark. The leaves are on stiff petioles and are 25 millimetres (0.98 in) long. Lamina is 2–8 centimetres (0.79–3.15 in) by 1–3 centimetres (0.39–1.18 in) long.\nIt has juvenile and adult leaf forms and loses its leaves in winter. The flowers are greenish and the fruits are juicy with black shiny seeds covered by a white, succulent cup of sepals, which are fed on by various birds and lizards.\nFlowers bloom from late spring to autumn, with it panicles occur usually in spring and summer. Fruits are present from November to April, sometimes till June.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe species was first described in 1786 by Georg Forster, as Coccoloba australis. It was transferred to the genus Muehlenbeckia in 1841 by Carl Meissner. Some sources, including Plants of the World Online, regard Muehlenbeckia adpressa as a synonym of this species. Others treat them as separate species.\n\nEcology\nM. australis prefers places with plenty of sunlight and climbing support, such as forest edges, cliff faces, scrub and regenerating vegetation. With its climbing and rapid growth form, it is capable of engulfing roadside trees, and has benefited from cleared habitats created since human settlement began, and is sometimes the only native species present in such areas.\n\nHost plant\nM. australis is a host plant for numerous New Zealand endemic insects including Pyrgotis eudorana, Apoctena orthropis, Argosarchus horridus, and Clitarchus hookeri.\nPassage 7:\nMuehlenbeckia horrida subsp. abdita\nMuehlenbeckia horrida subsp. abdita (syn. Duma horrida subsp. abdita). commonly known as remote thorny lignum, is a critically endangered shrub endemic to Western Australia.\n\nDescription\nIt is an upright, spreading, leafless shrub, that grows to a height of from 60 to 120 centimetres. It has bright, light yellow clusters of flowers.\nThe subspecies was described in 1996 by Karen Wilson.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nMuehlenbckia horrida subsp. abdita is known only from two populations within the Lake Bryde-East Lake Bryde wetland, in the Western Mallee subregion of the Mallee region in the South West Botanical Province of Western Australia.\nIt grows in waterlogged silt and sand, on the beds of Lake Bryde and East Lake Bryde. It depends for its survival upon a regular cycle of freshwater flooding followed by drying of the lake bed.\n\nConservation\nPopulations of M. h. subsp. abdita have declined severely in the last thirty years, mainly because of increasing salinity. Salinity loads in the Lakes were measured at around 160 tonnes in 1985, but had increased to around 1200 tonnes in 2005. This increase is attributable to a rising water table caused by widespread clearing for agriculture. Other threats include interruption of the flooding/drying regime because of altered hydrology; and recreational activities such as water skiing. It is estimated that there are about 2000 plants left. There was previously a third population, but these were all dead in 2002, and the population is thought to be unrecoverable.It is listed as ""critically endangered"" under Australia\'s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and as ""Rare"" under Western Australia\'s Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. The whole lake bed ecosystem has been classified as a critically endangered threatened ecological community under the name Bryde.\nPassage 8:\nMuehlenbeckia adpressa\nMuehlenbeckia adpressa, commonly known as climbing lignum, is a prostrate or climbing plant, native to Australia. It has thin red-brown stems up to 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) in length. The leaves are 1.5–6 centimetres (0.59–2.36 in) long and 1.5–3.5 centimetres (0.59–1.38 in) wide. It occurs in coastal areas of Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe species was first described in 1805 by Jacques Labillardière, as Polygonum adpressum. It was transferred to the genus Muehlenbeckia in 1843 by Carl Meissner. Some sources, including Plants of the World Online, regard M. adpressa as a synonym of M. australis. Others treat them as separate species.\n\nGallery\nPassage 9:\nMuehlenbeckia\nMuehlenbeckia or maidenhair is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the borders of the Pacific, including South and North America, Papua New Guinea and Australasia. It has been introduced elsewhere, including Europe. Species vary in their growth habits, many being vines or shrubs. In some environments, rampant species can become weedy and difficult to eradicate.\n\nDescription\nSpecies of Muehlenbeckia vary considerably in their growth habits; they may be perennials, vinelike, or shrubs. All have rhizomatous roots. Their leaves are arranged alternately on the stem, usually with stalks (petioles), but sometimes stalkless (sessile). The brownish ocrea is short and tubular, soon disintegrating. The inflorescences may be terminal or axillary, and are in the form of spikes or clusters, with at most very short peduncles (flowering stems). Individual flowers have pedicels (stalks). The flowers may be bisexual or unisexual, with sometimes a mixture of staminate, pistillate and bisexual flowers on the same plant. There are five white to greenish white tepals, joined at the base. Staminate flowers have 8 (sometimes 9) stamens and a rudimentary pistil. Pistillate flowers have rudimentary stamens and three spreading styles. The fruit is in the form of a black or dark brown unwinged achene, three-sided to more or less globe-shaped, at least partly enclosed by the persistent tepals.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe genus was erected by Carl Meissner in 1841, initially for two species that he distinguished from Coccoloba and Polygonum. The generic name honours Alsatian bryologist Heinrich Gustav Mühlenbeck (1798–1845).Muehlenbeckia is placed in the tribe Polygoneae of the subfamily Polygonoideae. Within the tribe, it is most closely related to the genera Reynoutria and Fallopia s.s., forming the so-called ""RMF clade"".\n\nSpecies\nAs of March 2019, Plants of the World Online recognized 24 species (see note below):\n\nSome sources, including Plants of the World Online, regard M. adpressa as a synonym of M. australis. Others treat them as separate species.Three species have been transferred to the genus Duma:\nMuehlenbeckia coccoloboides J.M.Black → Duma coccoloboides\nMuehlenbeckia florulenta Meisn. – tangled lignum → Duma florulenta\nMuehlenbeckia horrida H.Gross → Duma horrida\n\nDistribution\nNative\n\nAustralasia:\nAustralia: Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Norfolk Island, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia\nNew Zealand: Chatham Islands, New Zealand North, New Zealand South\nPapuasia: New Guinea\nNeotropic:\nCentral America: Honduras\nSouthern South America: Chile\n\nInvasiveness\nAll members of the RMF clade appear to have the potential to become invasive, in some cases via vigorous hybrids. The highly invasive Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica) hybridizes with Muehlenbeckia australis. The related Muehlenbeckia complexa has established populations in southern parts of Britain and in the Channel Islands, and is a problematic invasive species in the San Francisco area.\nPassage 10:\nMuehlenbeckia axillaris\nMuehlenbeckia axillaris (creeping wire vine, sprawling wire vine, matted lignum) is a low evergreen shrub, forming wiry mats up to about 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) in diameter, native to New Zealand, and the Australian states of Tasmania, New South Wales and Victoria. It has thin, red-brown stems, with glossy squarish to roundish leaves that are less than 1 cm (0.39 in) in diameter and 2–4 mm (0.079–0.157 in) thick. Flowers are inconspicuous, yellowish-white, 4–8 mm (0.16–0.31 in) in diameter, and borne in groups of up to three in the axils. The fruit is black, shiny, and up to 3.5 mm (0.14 in) long, produced in late summer to fall.\nThe plant is hardy, drought-tolerant, and quick-growing, thriving in a range of light conditions. It can be cultivated as a ground cover and grows well in rocky ground, as well as standard potting soil. Although it grows fastest in warm seasons, it tolerates freezing weather.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe species was first described by Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1847, who used the name ""Polygonum (Muhlenbeckia) axillaris"". Both Stephan Endlicher (in 1848) and Wilhelm Gerhard Walpers (in 1849) later referred to it as just Muehlenbeckia axillaris.\n\nSynonyms\nPseudanthus tasmanicus\n```\n\nQuestion: Are Euptelea and Muehlenbeckia both genuses?\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 3655, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 3655, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 8}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

Also known as the Hine–Buckingham Farms, the 137-acre (55 ha) property encompasses two farm properties that remained family-run from the 18th to early 20th centuries.  The property includes one 18th and several 19th-century farmhouses and other outbuildings.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.  The farmstead is now home to The Silo at Hunt Hill Farm, an arts and culinary organization, while much of the land is held as conservation land by the town.\n\nDescription and history\nHunt Hill Farm is located in a rural setting about 4 miles (6.4 km) north of New Milford center, in the uplands on the east side of the East Aspetuck River.  Its lands area combination of open fields and woodland, with the cluster of farm buildings set around the junction of Upland and Crossman Roads.  It includes three houses, built roughly between 1760 and 1836, as well as several barns, stables, and other outbuildings.  A prominent feature of the complex is a pair of circular silos, set close to the road junction in front of one of the barns.The history of these farm properties dates to the early 18th century, and the earliest period of New Milford\'s settlement.  Daniel Hine, a native Milford, settled in New Milford in 1737, and soon had a farm established here.  Abel Buckingham began farming land adjacent to Hines\'s in 1775.  The oldest of the three surviving houses was built about 1760 by Daniel Hines.  By the mid-19th century, both families were engaged in  dairy farming, sending their products to market via the Housatonic Railroad.  The Hines farm was sold out of the family in 1908, while that of the Buckinghams remained in that family until 1972, when it was sold to the Hendersons.  The Hines farm was purchased by the Hendersons in 1968, and the combined property was adapted by them to its present use as a culinary school and arts center.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Litchfield County, Connecticut\nPassage 2:\nGreen Hill Farm\nGreen Hill Farm was a 2,000-acre (8.1 km2) horse farm in Burlington Township, Burlington County, New Jersey, United States. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The land was owned and operated by families out of Burlington and Philadelphia. First, Green Hill was owned by Samuel Jennings, the acting Governor of West Jersey. Jennings purchased the property in 1681 and gave it the name Green Hill. It is possible that he named it after Green Hill near Kenilworth, Evesham in Worcester, England though there is not conclusive proof of this. In 1791, John Smith bought 340 acres (1.4 km2) of the Jennings property. The famous brick house located there was built between 1800 and 1803. The frame tenant house was the home of various families to work on the farm. The 9.5 acres that remain of Green Hill was purchased by Stephen and Helen Matlaga in 1973. The Matlagas and their extended family painstakingly restored the main house along with two tenant houses and converted the 1867 barn into a medical office. Dr. Stephen Matlaga still owns and operates Green Hill Chiropractic out of this space.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Burlington County, New Jersey\nPassage 3:\nMoose Hill Farm\nMoose Hill Farm is a 347-acre (140 ha) open space preserve and historic farm complex located in Sharon, Massachusetts near the 450 feet (140 m) summit of Moose Hill.

The attack, in the heavily fortified Green Zone of Baghdad, occurred ten minutes after the Council of Representatives had adjourned for lunch. It was on the first floor of the Baghdad Convention Center, which houses the parliament. Two further unexploded suicide vests were found near the canteen. The building had earlier been searched by dogs – very rare considering dogs are considered ritually unclean by Iraqis – suggesting the authorities suspected an attack was imminent. Following the attack the government closed down mobile phone networks and Apache helicopters flew overhead.\n\nCasualties\nThe US military reported on 13 April that only MP Mohammed Awad had died, and that 22 others were wounded.Early reports however had said that eight people were killed, including three MPs, and at least 23 people were reported wounded. The MPs named were Mohammed Awad, a member of the Iraqi National Dialogue Front, Taha al-Liheibi, a member of the Iraqi Accordance Front and an unnamed Kurdish MP.\n\nResponsibility\nSuspicions initially centered on the bomber having been the bodyguard of an MP. A government spokesman said ""there are some groups that work in politics during the day and do things other than politics at night"". Member of Parliament Mohammed al-Dayni accused the government of lax security at the site.On 13 April, the Islamic State of Iraq posted a message on an Islamist website claiming to have sent ""A knight from the state of Islam ... [into] the heart of the Green Zone"" to carry out the attack. It is not clear whether this claim is genuine, though some who monitor such websites believe it is.In February 2009, two bodyguards of Iraqi National Dialogue Front MP Mohammed al-Dayni were arrested on suspicion of the attacks. Alaa Khairallah Hashim, al-Dayni\'s security chief and Ryadh Ibrahim al-Dayni, Mohammed al-Dayni\'s nephew, confessed on television to involvement in several attacks, including the parliament bombing. They said the MP had given authorisation for the bomber to enter the parliament area. The security forces asked the Council of Representatives of Iraq to lift al-Dayni\'s parliamentary immunity. Mohammed al-Dayni claimed that the accusations were lies and that his bodyguards had been tortured into making a false confession because he had been disclosing human rights abuses in Iraqi prisons. al-Dayni took a flight to Jordan, but the aeroplane was forced to turn back; parliament then agreed to lift his immunity.\n\nReactions\nWhen the bombing occurred, Saleh al-Mutlaq, the head of oppositional Iraqi National Dialogue Front, the party of the killed MP Awad, called on the United States to overthrow the government of Nouri al-Maliki: ""We need America to realize that this pro-Iranian government it has installed has allowed interference on the side of one against the other"".The Iraqi Council of Representatives held an emergency assembly the following day in response to the bombing, to ""show resilience in the face of such attacks"".US President George W. Bush condemned the attacks, saying ""there is an enemy willing to bomb innocent people and a symbol of democracy"". The Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammad Ali Hosseini described the attack as ""inhumane and satanic ... target[ting] both its Shia and Sunni officials""Four days later three Ministers from the Sadrist Movement quit the government, citing, among other things, the growing insecurity in Baghdad.\n\nSee also\n2007 suicide bombings in Iraq\nList of attacks on legislatures\nPassage 10:\nAnant Nag filmography\nAnant Nag is an Indian actor and occasional film producer who appears as an actor in predominantly in Kannada films and a few Hindi and Telugu films.

Improvements followed in 2012, however, with a personal best to win the Chinese Universities title, followed by his first national title at the Chinese Championships with a best of 81.74 m (making him the sixth Chinese ever over that mark).He threw over eighty metres several times in 2013. He opened in Australia with a win at the Briggs Athletics Classic and runner-up placings at the Perth and Melbourne Track Classic. While there he trained with former world record holder Uwe Hohn. He threw 81.18 m at the Shanghai Diamond League meet then won a second national title. This earned him a debut at the 2013 World Championships in Athletics, though he did not breach the 80-metre mark then a failed to make the final. Success came after this disappointment as he won at the 12th Chinese Games with a mark of 83.14 m, moving up to third on the all-time Chinese lists. He won his first international gold medal at the 2013 East Asian Games, where his winning mark of 82.97 m was a new Games record for the event.\n\nSeasonal bests by year\n2008 – 77.20\n2009 – 79.62\n2010 – 79.80\n2011 – 78.40\n2012 – 81.74\n2013 – 83.14\n2014 – 89.15\n2015 – 79.47\n2016 – 80.42\n2017 – 80.04\n2018 – 62.88\n2019 – 83.84\nPassage 7:\nRobert Szpak\nRobert Szpak (born 31 December 1989 in Kołobrzeg) is a Polish athlete, who specialises in the javelin throw.

It was developed in 18th-century Britain by Richard Arkwright and John Kay.\n\nHistorical context\n\nIn 1760 England, yarn production from wool, flax and cotton was still a cottage industry in which fibres were carded and spun by hand using a spinning wheel.  As the textile industry expanded its markets and adopted faster machines, yarn supplies became scarce especially due to innovations such as the doubling of the loom speed after the invention of the flying shuttle.  High demand for yarn spurred invention of the spinning jenny in 1764, followed closely by the invention of the spinning frame, later developed into the water frame (patented in 1769).  Mechanisms had increased production of yarn so dramatically that by 1830 the yarn cottage industry in England could no longer compete and all spinning was carried out in factories. \n\nDevelopment\n\nRichard Arkwright employed John Kay to produce a new spinning machine that Kay had worked on with (or possibly stolen from) another inventor called Thomas Highs.   With the help of other local craftsmen the team produced the spinning frame, which produced a stronger thread than the spinning jenny produced by James Hargreaves.  The frame employed the draw rollers invented by Lewis Paul to stretch, or attenuate, the yarn.  \n\nThe roller spinning process starts with a thick \'string\' of lose fibers called a roving, which is passed between three pairs of rollers, each pair rotating slightly faster than the previous one. In this way it is reduced in thickness and increased in length before a strengthening twist is added by a bobbin-and-flyer mechanism.  The spacing of the rollers has to be slightly greater than the fiber length to prevent breakage. The nip of the roller pairs prevent the twist from backing up to the roving.\n\nToo large to be operated by hand, the spinning frame needed a new source of power.  Arkwright at first experimented with horses, but decided to employ the power of the water wheel, which gave the invention the name \'water frame\'.  \n\nFor some time, the stronger yarn produced by the spinning frame was used in looms for the lengthwise ""warp"" threads that bound cloth together, while hand powered jennies provided the weaker yarn used for the horizontal filler ""weft"" threads.  The jennies required skill but was inexpensive and could be used in a home.  The spinning frames required significant capital but required little skill.\nQuestion:\nWhich English inventor was responsible for the introduction of the multi-spool spinning frame known as the Spinning Jenny in1764?\nAnswer:\nJAMES HARGREAVES\nPassage:\nRide of the Valkyries\nThe ""Ride of the Valkyries"" () is the popular term for the beginning of act 3 of Die Walküre, the second of the four operas by Richard Wagner that constitute Der Ring des Nibelungen.\n\nAs a separate piece, the ""Ride"" is often heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes. Together with the ""Bridal Chorus"" from Lohengrin, the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" is one of Wagner\'s best-known pieces.\n\nContext \n\nIn the Walküre opera, the ""Ride"", which takes around eight minutes, begins in the prelude to the third act, building up successive layers of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal a mountain peak where four of the eight Valkyrie sisters of Brünnhilde have gathered in preparation for the transportation of fallen heroes to Valhalla. As they are joined by the other four, the familiar tune is carried by the orchestra, while, above it, the Valkyries greet each other and sing their battle-cry. Apart from the song of the Rhinemaidens in Das Rheingold, it is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner\'s Ring cycle.\n\nPerformance history \n\nThe complete opera Die Walküre was first performed on 26 June 1870 in the National Theatre Munich against the composer\'s intent. By January of the next year, Wagner was receiving requests for the ""Ride"" to be performed separately, but wrote that such a performance should be considered ""an utter indiscretion"" and forbade ""any such thing"".  However, the piece was still printed and sold in Leipzig, and Wagner subsequently wrote a complaint to the publisher Schott.  In the period up to the first performance of the complete Ring cycle, Wagner continued to receive requests for separate performances, his second wife Cosima noting ""Unsavoury letters arrive for R. – requests for the Ride of the Valkyries and I don\'t know what else.""  Once the Ring had been given in Bayreuth in 1876, Wagner lifted the embargo. He himself conducted it in London on 12 May 1877, repeating it as an encore. \n\nOutside opera \n\nIn film \n\nUses in film include the original score for The Birth of a Nation (1915),  and What\'s Opera, Doc? (1957). \n\nThe ""Ride"" is also associated with Apocalypse Now (1979),  where the 1/9 Air Cavalry regiment plays the piece of music on helicopter-mounted loudspeakers during their assault on a Vietnamese village as psychological warfare and to motivate their own troops. \n\nIn military \n\nThe ""Ride"" is the regimental quick march of the British Parachute Regiment. \n\nIn music \n\nWithin the concert repertoire, the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" remains a popular encore, especially when other Wagnerian extracts feature in the scheduled program. For example, at the BBC Proms it was performed as such by Klaus Tennstedt and the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 6 August 1992  and also by Valery Gergiev with the Kirov Orchestra on 28 August 2001. \n\nDiscography \n\nApart from where the ""Ride"" is included in the recordings of the Walküre opera, it is a very popular piece, included in various popular classics anthologies. For instance in Deutsche Grammophon\'s 1991 Classicmania two CD album (von Karajan version), and in Brilliant Classics\' 2011 Best Film Classics CD box, there included in the fifth CD, Opera at the Movies, with a reference to Apocalypse Now on the sleeve.\nQuestion:\n\'The Ride of the Valkyries\' was composed by who?\nAnswer:\nWagner\'s\nPassage:\nChicago-style pizza\nChicago-style pizza refers to several different styles of pizza developed in Chicago. Arguably, the most famous of these is known as deep-dish pizza. The pan in which it is baked gives the pizza its characteristically high edge and a deep surface for large amounts of cheese and a chunky tomato sauce. Chicago-style pizza may be prepared in deep-dish style and as a stuffed pizza.  \n\nStyles\n\nDeep-dish pizza\n\nAccording to Tim Samuelson, Chicago\'s official cultural historian, there is not enough documentation to determine with certainty who invented Chicago-style deep-dish pizza.  It is often reported that Chicago-style deep-dish pizza was invented at Pizzeria Uno in Chicago, in 1943,[http://members.cox.net/jjschnebel/ddishpiz.html Who Cooked That Up?] by Uno\'s founder Ike Sewell, a former University of Texas football star. However, a 1956 article from the Chicago Daily News asserts that Uno\'s original pizza chef Rudy Malnati developed the recipe. \n\nThe primary difference between deep-dish pizza and most other forms of pizza is that, as the name suggests, the crust is very deep, creating a very thick pizza that resembles a pie more than a flatbread. Although the entire pizza is very thick, in traditional Chicago-style deep-dish pizzas, the crust itself is thin to medium in thickness.\n\nDeep-dish pizza is baked in a round, steel pan that is more similar to a cake or pie pan than a typical pizza pan. The pan is oiled in order to allow for easy removal as well as to create a fried effect on the outside of the crust. In addition to ordinary wheat flour, the pizza dough may contain corn meal, semolina, or food coloring, giving the crust a distinctly yellowish tone. The dough is pressed up onto the sides of the pan, forming a bowl for a very thick layer of toppings.\n\nThe thick layer of toppings used in deep-dish pizza requires a longer baking time, which could burn cheese or other toppings if they were used as the top layer of the pizza. Because of this, the toppings are assembled ""upside-down"" from their usual order on a pizza. The crust is covered with cheese (generally sliced mozzarella), followed by various meat options such as pepperoni or sausage, the latter of which is sometimes in a solid patty-like layer. Other toppings such as onions, mushrooms and bell peppers are then also used. An uncooked sauce, typically made from crushed canned tomatoes, is added as the finishing layer; though sometimes, a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese is added for extra flavor. It is typical that when ordered for carry-out or delivery, the pizza is uncut, as this prevents the oils from soaking into the crust, causing the pie to become soggy.\n\nSome Chicago deep-dish pizza restaurants ship their partially baked pizzas within the continental U.S. \n\nFile:Pizzeria Uno Chicago-style deep-dish pizza.jpg |Deep-dish pizza from the original Pizzeria Uno location\nFile:Chicago-style-pizza-03.jpg |Deep-dish pizza from Lou Malnati\'s\nFile:Kitchen 17 Vegan Sausage Deep Dish.jpg |Deep-dish pizza from vegan restaurant Kitchen 17 in Chicago\n\nStuffed pizza\n\nBy the mid-1970s, two Chicago chains, Nancy\'s Pizza, founded by Rocco Palese, and Giordano\'s Pizzeria, operated by brothers Efren and Joseph Boglio, began experimenting with deep dish pizza and created the stuffed pizza.  Palese based his creation on his mother\'s recipe for scarciedda, an Italian Easter pie from his hometown of Potenza.  Chicago Magazine articles featuring Nancy\'s Pizza and Giordano\'s stuffed pizza popularized the dish.\n\nStuffed pizzas are often even deeper than deep-dish pizzas, but otherwise, it can be hard to see the difference until it is cut into. A stuffed pizza generally has much deeper topping density than any other type of pizza. As with deep-dish pizza, a deep layer of dough forms a bowl in a high-sided pan and the toppings and cheese are added. Then, an additional layer of dough goes on top and is pressed to the sides of the crust.\n\nAt this stage, the thin dough top has a rounded, domed appearance. Pizza makers often poke a small hole in the top of the ""lid"" to allow air and steam to escape while cooking, so that the pizza does not explode. Usually, but not always, tomato sauce is ladled over the top crust before the pizza is baked.\n\nThin-crust pizza\n\nThere is also a style of thin-crust pizza found in Chicago and throughout the rest of the Midwest. The crust is thin and firm enough to have a noticeable crunch, unlike a New York-style pizza. This pizza is cut into squares, also known as party cut or tavern cut,  as opposed to a pie cut into wedges. Aurelios is a chain which specializes in this kind of pizza. Casa Bianca,  located in the Eagle Rock section of Los Angeles, is also well known for this style of thin-crusted Chicago bar pizza.[http://www.laweekly.com/2009-07-02/eat-drink/first-date-italian-style/ Celestino: First Date, Italian-Style - Page 1 - Eat+Drink - Los Angeles - LA Weekly][http://extratv.warnerbros.com/2008/11/baracks_favorite_pizzeria_head.php Where\'s Obama\'s Favorite Pizza? | ExtraTV.com][http://casabiancapizza.com/history.html Casa Bianaca Pizza (history)]\nQuestion:\nWhat type of pizza is Chicago known for?\nAnswer:\nDeep Dish (disambiguation)\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nGuillemot\nGuillemots is the common name for several species of seabird in the auk family (part of the order Charadriiformes).  In British use, the term comprises two genera: Uria and Cepphus. In North America the Uria species are called ""murres"" and only the Cepphus species are called ""guillemots"". This word of French origin apparently derives from a form of the name William, cf. . \n\nThe two living species of Uria, together with the razorbill, dovekie and the extinct great auk, make up the tribe Alcini.  They have distinctly white bellies, thicker and longer bills than Cepphus, and form very dense colonies on cliffs during the reproductive season. \n\nThe three living species of Cepphus form a tribe of their own: Cepphini.   They are smaller than the Uria species and have black bellies, rounder heads and bright red feet.\n\nIn July 2013, Dr Steven Portugal from the Royal Veterinary College demonstrated that when water touches the eggs, it forms into droplets rather than running off; in other words, guillemot eggs are water-repellant and self-cleaning.\n\nSystematics\n\nUria\n\n*Common murre or common guillemot, Uria aalge\n*Thick-billed murre or Brünnich\'s guillemot, Uria lomvia\n\nSome prehistoric species are also known:\n\n* Uria bordkorbi (Monterey or Sisquoc Late Miocene of Lompoc, USA)\n* Uria affinis (Late Pleistocene of E USA)—possibly a subspecies of U. lomvia\n* Uria paleohesperis\n\nU. brodkorbi is the only known occurrence of the Alcini tribe in the temperate to subtropical Pacific, except for the very fringe of the range of U. aalge.\n\nCepphus\n\n* Black guillemot or tystie,  Cepphus grylle\n* Pigeon guillemot,  Cepphus columba\n* Spectacled guillemot,  Cepphus carbo\n\nAs in other genera of auks, fossils of prehistoric forms of Cepphus have been found:\n\n* Cepphus olsoni (San Luis Rey River Late Miocene—Early Pliocene of W USA)\n* Cepphus cf. columba (Lawrence Canyon Early Pliocene of W USA)\n* Cepphus cf. grylle (San Diego Late Pliocene, W USA)\n\nThe latter two resemble the extant species, but because of the considerable distance in time or space from their current occurrence, they may represent distinct species.\nQuestion:\nWhat kind of bird is a guillemot?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 3882, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 3882, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 6}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

It is taken to represent the queen Cassiopeia of the mythical kingdom Ethiopia. In Greek mythology, Cassiopeia offended the Nereids (sea nymphs) by boasting about being more beautiful than them. As punishment for her vanity, she had to sacrifice her daughter Andromeda to appease the sea monster Cetus sent by Poseidon. It is said that, once placed in the sky, Cassiopeia was condemned to circle the celestial pole forever, sometimes hanging upside down, as additional punishment. The constellation is quite easy to spot in the sky because five of its bright stars form a distinctive \'W\' shape.\nThe constellation Cassiopeia occupies an area of 598 square degrees and contains three stars with known planets. It can be seen at latitudes between +90° and -20° and is best visible at 9 p.m. during the month of November.\n[1959] beta Cassiopeiae or Caph (""palm"") is a yellow-white giant with a magnitude of 2.28, classified as a Delta Scuti type variable. It is twice the size of the Sun and 28 times brighter.\n[1878] alpha Cassiopeiae, Shedir or Shedar (""the breast"") has a magnitude of 2.25 and is the second brightest star in the constellation. It is an orange giant more than 500 times brighter than the Sun.\n[1880] gamma Cassiopeiae is the central star of the constellation. It is an eruptive variable star. It does not have a traditional Latin or Arabic name, but the Chinesse call it Tsih (""the whip""). At maximum intensity (currently 2.15), the star outshines both alpha and beta Cassiopeiae. Gamma Cassiopeiae spins very rapidly and bulges along the equator, which causes it to lose mass. As a result, a disk forms around the star which is responsible for the variations in brightness and emissions.\n[1881] delta Cassiopeiae, also known as Ksora or Ruchbah (""knee"") is an eclipsing binary star about 99 light-years distant. It has an apparent visual magnitude that varies between 2.68 and 2.71.\n[1882] epsilon Cassiopeiae, also called Segin, is a blue-white giant about 442 light-years away from Earth. Its luminosity is 720 times that of the Sun.\n[1891] rho Cassiopeiae and V509 Cassiopeiae are among the most luminous stars visible to the naked eye in the galaxy. [1883] eta Cassiopeiae is a binary star consisting of a yellow dwarf similar to our Sun and an orange dwarf.\nCassiopeia also has two notable Messier objects, both open star clusters. Messier 52 or NGC 7654 was discovered by Charles Messier in 1774 and can be seen with binoculars. In stronger telescopes, it appears as a rich, V-shaped cluster of faint stars with a bright yellow star on the edge.\nMessier 103 or NGC 581 was the last Messier object to be catalogued by Charles Messier himself. At about 8,000 light-years away, it is one of the more remote open clusters to be catalogued. It contains between 40 and 50 stars, the brightest one of which is Struve 131 or HD 9311. The cluster is faint, but once found, it has the appearance of curving star chains streaming outward from the centre.\nTycho\'s Star or CN 1572, observed as a supernova in 1572 and documented by the Danish nobleman and astronomer Tycho Brahe, is also located in Cassiopeia. The star named Tycho G is being studied as a possible companion to the star that created the supernova. The other supernova remnant in the constellation is Cassiopeia A, the strongest radio source outside our solar system that can be observed. The cloud of material left over from the supernova is now about 10 light-years across.\nFinally, the constellation contains an irregular galaxy, IC 10, first discovered by Lewis Swift in 1887. It is somewhat difficult to study because, located near the Milky Way plane, it is obscured by interstellar matter. With an exceptionally high rate of star formation, however, IC 10 is known as the only starburst galaxy in the Local Group.\nQuestion:\nIn which constellation do the five main stars form a \'W\' shape?\nAnswer:\nCassiepeia\nPassage:\nHysteria\nHysteria, in the colloquial use of the term, means ungovernable emotional excess. Generally, modern medical professionals have abandoned using the term ""hysteria"" to denote a diagnostic category, replacing it with more precisely defined categories, such as somatization disorder. In 1980, the American Psychiatric Association officially changed the diagnosis of ""hysterical neurosis, conversion type"" (the most extreme and effective type) to ""conversion disorder"".\n\nHistory\n\nFor at least 2,000 years of European history until the late 19th century, the term ""hysteria"" referred to a medical condition thought to be particular to women and caused by disturbances of the uterus (from the Greek ὑστέρα hystera ""uterus""), such as when a newborn child emerges from the birth canal. The origin of the term is commonly attributed to Hippocrates, even though it is not used in the writings that are collectively known as the Hippocratic corpus.  The Hippocratic corpus refers to a variety of illness symptoms – such as suffocation and Heracles\' disease – which were supposedly caused by the movement of a woman\'s uterus to various locations within her body as it became light and dry due to a lack of bodily fluids. One passage recommends pregnancy to cure such symptoms, ostensibly because intercourse will ""moisten"" the womb and facilitate blood circulation within the body. The ""wandering womb"" theory persisted in European medicine for centuries.\n\nBy the mid- to late 19th century, hysteria (sometimes called female hysteria) had come to refer to what is today generally considered to be sexual dysfunction. Typical treatment was massage of the patient\'s genitalia by the physician and, later, by vibrators or water sprays to cause orgasm. A male counterpart of the diagnosis of hysteria, which then almost exclusively applied to women, was associated with symptoms now mostly considered to be signs of PTSD.\n\nA more modern understanding of hysteria as a psychological disorder was advanced by the work of Jean-Martin Charcot, a French neurologist. In his 1893 obituary of Charcot, Sigmund Freud attributed the rehabilitation of hysteria as a topic for scientific study to the positive attention generated by Charcot’s neuropathological investigations of hysteria during the last ten years of his life., first published in  Freud questioned Charcot’s claim that heredity is the unique cause of hysteria, but he lauded his innovative clinical use of hypnosis to demonstrate how hysterical paralysis could result from psychological factors produced by non-organic traumas (psychological factors that Charcot believed could be simulated using hypnosis). According to Freud, this discovery allowed subsequent investigators such as Pierre Janet and Josef Breuer to develop new theories of hysteria that were essentially similar to the medieval conception of split consciousness, but with the non-scientific terminology of demonic possession replaced with modern psychological concepts.\n\nIn the early 1890s Freud published a series of articles on hysteria which popularized Charcot\'s earlier work, and began the development of his own views on hysteria. By the 1920s Freud\'s theory on hysteria was influential in the UK and the US. Freudian psychoanalytic theory attributed hysterical symptoms to the unconscious mind\'s attempt to protect the patient from psychic stress. Unconscious motives include primary gain, in which the symptom directly relieves the stress (as when a patient coughs to release energy pent up from keeping a secret), and secondary gain, in which the symptom provides an independent advantage, such as staying at home away from a hated job. More recent critics have noted the possibility of tertiary gain, as when a patient is induced unconsciously to display a symptom because of the desires of others (for instance when a controlling spouse enjoys the docility of his or her sick partner).  \n\nJudith Herman suggests, in Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence: From Domestic Abuse to Political Terror,  that hysteria was a label given to a form of PTSD arising from routine domestic abuse of women, including physical abuse, rape, and emotional abuse. She describes the work of Charcot and Freud, which had resulted in Freud\'s finding in ""The Aetiology of Hysteria"" in 1896 (which he later repudiated):\n\n""I therefore put forward the thesis that at the bottom of every case of hysteria there are  one or more occurrences of premature sexual experience ... "". \n\nCurrent theories and practices\n\nCurrent psychiatric terminology distinguishes two types of disorder that were previously labelled ""hysteria"": somatoform disorder and dissociative disorder. There are many cases of these disorders where nothing else can be diagnosed in the sufferers. The dissociative disorders in DSM-IV-TR include dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, dissociative identity disorder, depersonalization disorder, and dissociative disorder not otherwise specified. Somatoform disorders include conversion disorder, somatization disorder, pain disorder, hypochondriasis, and body dysmorphic disorder. In somatoform disorders, the patient exhibits physical symptoms, such as low back pain or limb paralysis, which have no  apparent physical cause. Additionally, certain culture-bound syndromes – such as ""ataques de nervios"" (""attacks of nerves"") identified in Hispanic populations, and popularized by Pedro Almodóvar\'s film Women on the Verge of a Nervous  Breakdown – exemplify psychiatric phenomena which encompass both somatoform and dissociative symptoms, and have been linked to psychological trauma.  Recent neuroscientific research is now beginning to show that there are characteristic patterns of brain activity associated with these states.  All these disorders are thought to be unconscious, not feigned and not intentional malingering.\n\nJungian psychologist Laurie Layton Schapira has explored the ""Cassandra Complex"" suffered by those traditionally diagnosed with hysteria.   Basing her findings on clinical experience, she delineates three factors which constitute the Cassandra Complex in hysterics: (a) dysfunctional relationships, with social manifestations of rationality, order and reason, leading to (b) emotional or physical suffering, particularly in the form of somatic, often gynaecological complaints, and\n(c) sufferers being disbelieved or dismissed when attempting to relate the facticity of these experiences to others.\n\nMass hysteria\n\nThe term also occurs in the phrase ""mass hysteria"" to describe mass public near-panic reactions. Hysteria was often associated with events such as the Salem witch trials, or slave revolt.\nQuestion:\nWhose Selected Papers on Hysteria, translated in 1909 by Abraham Brill, introduced the word libido into English?\nAnswer:\nZigi Frojd\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nstereophonics - dakota - YouTube\nstereophonics - dakota - YouTube\nstereophonics - dakota\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

Other? and was released on February 28, 2005. It was the first Stereophonics single to reach #1 on the UK Singles Chart or to chart on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song spent a total of 20 weeks on the UK singles chart, and it also topped the download chart, remaining on the chart for 22 weeks, half of which were spent in the top 10. The single received good reviews, James Masterton calling it the single of the year.\n""Dakota"" was the first Stereophonics single to achieve success on alternative rock radio stations in the United States, and as such represents their American breakthrough single.[citation needed] Before ""Dakota"", no Stereophonics single had charted on any rock charts in the U.S. After its release in February, the single steadily gained ground on U.S. alternative rock radio. However, since the Stereophonics lacked a fanbase or previous popular success in America, the single was at a great disadvantage and was initially added to very few station playlists. Nevertheless, the popularity of the song and its championing by such stations as WBCN led ""Dakota"" slowly to gain airplay and playlist adds across the country over a period of many months. It became one of the 50 most-played songs in the US by mid-May 2005. However, the song lingered just within the top 50 for months and seemed destined to just miss the Modern Rock Tracks chart, a compilation of just the top 40 most-played alternative rock songs in the US.\nBut ""Dakota"" continued to gain support across the U.S. and eventually become the first Stereophonics song to chart on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. It first charted on July 9, 2005, almost half a year after its original release. The song reached #34 on the chart; it was their first and so-far only single to make the chart.\nCategory\nQuestion:\nWhat was the UK #1 single released by the band Stereophonics in 2005?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 3616, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 3616, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 6}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

Subsequent revisions of the book were published in 1986, 1989, 2000, and 2008.\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe first few chapters following the brief introduction about Bundy\'s birth and family describe Rule\'s friendship with Bundy, her first impressions of him, and her reluctance to consider the evidence that he might be responsible for the crimes of which he was accused.\n\nThe events of the Chi Omega murders at Florida State University in January 1978 are written in third person, but not omnisciently, as the perpetrator is not identified as being Bundy, thus keeping the documentation of these events in-sync with the knowledge available to officers at the time.\n\nIt is not until Bundy\'s capture and trials in Florida that Rule fully accepts that Bundy is a serial killer. She finds the idea shocking to the point that she ""[runs] to the ladies room and throws up.""  An afterword, following Rule\'s lament for Bundy and his victims, describes the Kimberly Leach trial. The 1989 update outlines Bundy\'s execution, and the 2000 update touches on many things, including various women claiming to have encountered Bundy in the 1970s, Robert Keppel\'s retirement from detective work and his employment at the University of Washington, and Bundy\'s possible involvement in the unsolved disappearance of Ann Marie Burr, a girl who disappeared in 1961 when Bundy was 14. \n\nA 2008 update of the book includes more stories from women who have contacted Rule with stories of their ""near-miss"" contacts with a man they believe was Ted Bundy, and also a ""Ted Bundy FAQ"" section in which Rule tries to answer the questions most frequently asked by readers, including the fact that he was not responsible for the 1973 murder of Kathy Merry Devine, for which he was long suspected. DNA testing linked that killing to an ex-convict named William Cosden, who was subsequently tried and convicted of her murder.\n\nFilm adaptation\n\nIn 2003, The Stranger Beside Me was adapted into a made-for-TV film, starring Billy Campbell as Bundy and Barbara Hershey as Rule.\nQuestion:\nAnn Rules book The Stranger Beside Me, is about what serial killer, assumed to have murdered 35 people, before hitting the electric chair in Starke, Florida on January 24, 1989?\nAnswer:\nMelissa Smith (murder victim)\nPassage:\nGulf of Bothnia\nThe Gulf of Bothnia (; ) is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It is situated between Finland\'s west coast and Sweden\'s east coast. In the south of the gulf lie the Åland Islands, between the Sea of Åland and the Archipelago Sea.\n\nName\n\nBothnia is a latinization. The Swedish name ""Bottenviken"" was originally just ""Botn(en)"" with botn being Old Norse for ""gulf"" or ""bay"";  which is also the meaning of the second element ""vik"".\n\nThe name botn was applied to the Gulf of Bothnia as Helsingjabotn in Old Norse, after Hälsingland, which at the time referred to the coastland west of the gulf. Later, botten was applied to the regions Västerbotten on the western side and Österbotten the eastern side (""East Bottom"" and ""West Bottom""). The Finnish name of Österbotten, Pohjanmaa, or ""Pohja""-land, gives a hint as to the meaning in both languages: pohja means both ""bottom"" and ""north.""\n\nBotn/botten is cognate with the English word bottom, and it might be part of a general north European distinction of lowlands, as opposed to highlands, such as the Netherlandic region, Samogitia (Lithuanian), and Sambia (Russia).\n\nA second possibility is that botten follows an alternative Scandinavian connotation of \'furthermost\'. Thus, the Gulf of Bothnia would be the farthest extent of the Ocean.\n\nJulius Pokorny gives the extended Indo-European root as *bhudh-m(e)n with a *bhudh-no- variant, from which the Latin fundus, as in fundament, is derived. The original meaning of English north, from Indo-European *ner- ""under"", indicates an original sense of ""lowlands"" for ""bottomlands"". On the other hand, by ""north"" the classical authors usually meant ""outermost"", as the northern lands were outermost to them.\n\nThe origin of the word is indeed very ancient, belonging to a period before the world discoveries by the Portuguese. Until then, North was not seen as the magnetic top of the world, East being the normal orientation of a map. \n\nAlso, in Saami, the cardinal directions were named according to the different parts of the typical tent used by this nomadic people. The door of the tent was traditionally pointed South, in the most sunny direction, and the bottom of the tent would be aligned with the North. Thus the origin of the word \'Pohja\' in its use as ""North"". Deriving as well from this logic is the affinity in the Finnish language of the words \'eteinen\', meaning ""entrance room/hall"" and \'Etelä\', ""South"".\n\nGeography\n\nExtent\n\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the southern limit of the Gulf of Bothnia as follows: \n\nFrom Simpnäsklubb (59°54\'N) in Sweden, to Flötjan, Lagskær [sic], Fæstörne [sic], Kökarsörn, and Vænö-Kalkskær [sic] to the SW point of Hangöudde (Hangö Head, 59°49\'N) in Finland, thus including the Aland islands and adjacent shoals and channels in the Gulf of Bothnia.\n\nGeophysical data\n\nThe gulf is 725\xa0km (450\xa0mi) long, 80–240\xa0km (50-150\xa0mi) wide and has an average depth of 60 m (200\xa0ft, 33 fathoms). The maximum depth is 295 m (965\xa0ft, 161 fathoms). The surface area is 117,000\xa0km² (45,200 sq mi). The northernmost point is situated in Töre in the Bothnian Bay. its coordinates are 65° 54\'07"" N 22° 39\'00 E. \n\nThe depth and surface area of Gulf if Bothnia are constantly decreasing, as the land is rising after it had been pressed down by the continental ice during last ice age.  The rise is 80 cm every hundred years. \n\nInto the gulf flow a number of rivers from both sides; consequently, a salinity gradient exists from north to south.\nIn the south the water is the normal brackish water of the Baltic Sea, but in the north, in the Bothnian Bay, the salinity is so low,  from 0.4% near Kvarken to 0.2% in the northernmost part,  and many freshwater fish such as the pike, whitefish and perch thrive in it.\n\nBeing nearly fresh, the gulf is frozen over five months every year. The icing of the Baltic Sea begins and ends in the northern Gulf of Bothnia. Traffic restrictions for ice breaker assistance are typically in force for all the gulf from late January to late April and for the northernmost ports from the middle of December to the middle of May. \n\nGeological history\n\nFor the geological history of the entire region, refer to the Baltic Sea.\n\nHistory\n\nSome historians suggest that the adventurer Ottar was referring to the Gulf of Bothnia when he spoke of the Kven Sea in the 9th century. It is also possible that Claudius Clavus\'s usage of the term Mare Gotticus in the 15th century refers to the Gulf of Bothnia.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe land surrounding the Gulf of Bothnia is heavily forested. Trees are logged, then transported to the coast for milling. The gulf is also important for oil transport to the coastal cities and ore transport to steel mills, for instance in Raahe.\n\nIn terms of  tonnage in international traffic,  the largest ports on the Finnish side are Rauma, Kokkola and Tornio. The main ports of the Swedish side are in Luleå, Skellefteå, Umeå, Sundsvall, Gävle and Hargshamn. In Luleå, iron ore pellets are exported and coal is imported. Gävle is Sweden\'s third-largest container port. It also ships forest products and oil.  The Gulf of Bothnia, ice breakers assist the ports needed in average half a year, when the Gulf of Finland, the season is only three months. \n\nThere is some fishery, mainly Baltic herring, for domestic needs. A persistent problem has been pollution, because the sea is enclosed by a large drainage basin and is poorly connected to fresher waters from the Atlantic. Mercury and PCB levels have been relatively high, although the Finnish Food Safety Authority considers the herring edible. Although the levels exceed the limits, the fatty acids have health benefits that offset this risk.\n\nRivers\n\n*Kemijoki\n*Kokemäenjoki\n*Oulujoki\n*Dalälven\n*Ljusnan\n*Ljungan\n*Indalsälven\n*Ångerman River\n*Ume River\n*Skellefte River\n*Pite River\n*Lule River\n*Kalix River\n*Torne River\n\nCities\n\n*Oulu\n*Pori\n*Rauma\n*Vaasa\n*Luleå\n*Umeå\n*Härnösand\n*Sundsvall\n*Gävle\n*Jakobstad\nQuestion:\nWhere is the Gulf of Bothnia?\nAnswer:\nMare Suevicum\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nDeath to Spies\nReleased in 2007, Death to Spies () is a stealth third-person shooter PC game set in World War II and produced by 1C Company and Haggard Games. The game was released on Valve\'s digital distribution system, Steam, on March 12, 2008.\n\nGameplay\n\nDeath to Spies takes place from a third-person perspective. The player controls Semion Strogov, a captain in a Soviet counterintelligence agency named SMERSH. Strogov is able to run, jump, crouch, crawl and climb over obstacles, and he is also able to drive vehicles. Taking place in World War II, the player is required to complete various tasks in enemy territory, such as killing targets and stealing documents. Emphasis is placed on stealth, as the player is greatly outnumbered by enemy personnel, and some missions will be failed if the alarm is raised. \n\nThe game\'s missions are connected by cutscenes, taking place in 1951. After the arrest of the head of SMERSH Viktor Abakumov, Semion Strogov is questioned about his involvement in a number of special operations between 1943 through 1946, as his interrogators search for any connections between him and Abakumov.\n\nThe Heads-up display shows the level of awareness and suspicion of enemies, both of which are represented with a single bar at the top of the screen and are represented separately as different icons. A vector map can be displayed on the screen, showing characters\' locations and their fields of vision, in which the player will be detected either instantly or gradually, depending on the distance. The vector map also shows the radius of noises made by the player; if someone is within the radius of the noise, they may investigate the noise or become alerted, depending on the noise.\n\nDisguises can be used to avoid alerting enemies when seen. When a character is knocked unconscious or killed without damaging the uniform, Strogov can change into their clothes. Some enemies are able to see through disguises and can be alerted if the player enters their vision, and all enemies can be alerted to suspicious behaviour which includes picking the lock of a door or looking through a door\'s keyhole, being in certain stances or having certain weapons visible.\n\nBefore starting a mission, the player is usually able to select equipment to bring to the mission. Strogov has a carrying capacity limited to one handgun, one long gun and 18 slots for small items such as ammunition and knives; one knife can also be stored in a dedicated slot. A backpack has space for larger items such as pliers and dynamite, and space for small items, but Strogov also has a weight limit to his inventory, and small items stored in a backpack must be moved to the 18 slots before it can be used.\nA variety of firearms (along with ammunition) and explosives are available to choose from, with the choices available depending on the mission. Other weapons include chloroform, knives, a garrote and poison. German equipment can also be chosen to avoid suspicion from enemy personnel when in disguise and/or to make use of ammunition taken from enemies\' bodies.\n\nSeveral missions take place in allied areas. The player is forced to begin these missions lightly armed and they cannot select their equipment. However, weapons and ammunition can be found in the level.\n\nReception\n\nDeath to Spies mostly received above average reviews. The game has an average score of 70% on Game Rankings  and 69% on Metacritic.  GameSpot gave it a 7.0, praising its detailed level design variation and challenging missions, but at the same time noting that the game can be overly difficult at times. IGN gave it an 8.0, saying it was ""horrifically difficult at times and not without its peculiarities; Death to Spies is nevertheless always interesting and wholly addictive."" \n\nSequel\n\nOn March 23, 2009 1C Company announced a sequel, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth.  It was released on August 10, 2009.\nQuestion:\nWhich counter-intelligence agency had a name meaning ‘death to spies’ in English?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 3567, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 3567, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 6}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

A 2002 article in the Village Voice by Ed Park said he might have been English by birth but was more probably American. The article said he might have served in the navy and that he has been incorrectly called a graduate of MIT. The article says that he attended a vocational high school attached to MIT in 1888 but there is no record that he graduated. Park said rumors that Wright died within hours of Gadsby being published are untrue. \n\nIn October 1930 Wright approached the Evening Independent newspaper and proposed it sponsor a blue lipogram writing competition, with $250 for the winner. In the letter, he boasted of the quality of Gadsby. The newspaper declined his offer. \n\nA 2007 post on the Bookride blog about rare books says Wright spent five and a half months writing Gadsby on a typewriter with the ""e"" key tied down. According to the unsigned entry at Bookride, a warehouse holding copies of Gadsby burned shortly after the book was printed, destroying ""most copies of the ill fated novel."" The blog post says the book was never reviewed ""and only kept alive by the efforts of a few avant garde French intellos and assorted connoisseurs of the odd, weird and zany."" The book\'s scarcity and oddness has seen copies priced at $4,000 by book dealers.[http://www.bookride.com/2007/02/gadsby-story-of-over-50000-words_24.html   Bookride blog] February 24, 2007.\n\nWright completed a draft of Gadsby in 1936, during a nearly six month stint at the National Military Home in California. He failed to find a publisher and used a self-publishing press to bring out the book.\n\nWright previously authored three other books: The Wonderful Fairies of the Sun (1896), The Fairies That Run the World and How They Do It (1903), and Thoughts and Reveries of an American Bluejacket (1918). His humorous poem, ""When Father Carves the Duck"", can be found in some anthologies.\nQuestion:\n""Ernest Vincent Wright wrote a novel, """"Gadsby"""", which contains over 50,000 words -- none of them with which letter?""\nAnswer:\n⒠\nPassage:\nWilliam Holman Hunt\nWilliam Holman Hunt  (2 April 1827 – 7 September 1910) was an English painter and one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.  His paintings were notable for their great attention to detail, vivid color, and elaborate symbolism.  These features were influenced by the writings of John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle, according to whom the world itself should be read as a system of visual signs.  For Hunt it was the duty of the artist to reveal the correspondence between sign and fact.  Of all the members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Hunt remained most true to their ideals throughout his career.  He was always keen to maximize the popular appeal and public visibility of his works. \n\nBiography\n\nWilliam Holman Hunt changed his middle name from ""Hobman"" to Holman when he discovered that a clerk had misspelled the name after his baptism at the church of Saint Mary the Virgin, Ewell.  After eventually entering the Royal Academy art schools, having initially been rejected, Hunt rebelled against the influence of its founder Sir Joshua Reynolds. He formed the Pre-Raphaelite movement in 1848, after meeting the poet and artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Along with John Everett Millais they sought to revitalise art by emphasising the detailed observation of the natural world in a spirit of quasi-religious devotion to truth. This religious approach was influenced by the spiritual qualities of medieval art, in opposition to the alleged rationalism of the Renaissance embodied by Raphael. He had many pupils including Robert Braithwaite Martineau.\n\nHunt married twice. After a failed engagement to his model Annie Miller, he married Fanny Waugh, who later modelled for the figure of Isabella. When she died in childbirth in Italy he sculpted her tomb at Fiesole, having it brought down to the English Cemetery, beside the tomb of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. He had a close connection with St. Mark\'s Church in Florence, and paid for a communion chalice inscribed in the memory of his wife. His second wife, Edith, was Fanny\'s sister. At this time it was illegal in Britain to marry one\'s deceased wife\'s sister, so Hunt was forced to travel abroad to marry her. This led to a serious breach with other family members, notably his former Pre-Raphaelite colleague Thomas Woolner, who had once been in love with Fanny and had married Alice, the third sister of Fanny and Edith.\n\nHunt\'s works were not initially successful, and were widely attacked in the art press for their alleged clumsiness and ugliness. He achieved some early note for his intensely naturalistic scenes of modern rural and urban life, such as The Hireling Shepherd and The Awakening Conscience. However, it was with his religious paintings that he became famous, initially The Light of the World (1851–1853), now in the chapel at Keble College, Oxford; a later version (1900) toured the world and now has its home in St Paul\'s Cathedral.\n\nIn the mid-1850s Hunt travelled to the Holy Land in search of accurate topographical and ethnographical material for further religious works, and to “use my powers to make more tangible Jesus Christ’s history and teaching”;  there he painted The Scapegoat, The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple and The Shadow of Death, along with many landscapes of the region. Hunt also painted many works based on poems, such as Isabella and The Lady of Shalott. He eventually built his own house in Jerusalem \n\nHe eventually had to give up painting because failing eyesight meant that he could not get the level of quality that he wanted. His last major works, a large version of The Light of the World were completed with the help of his assistant Edward Robert Hughes.\n\nHunt died on 7 September 1910 and was buried in St Paul\'s Cathedral \n\nAwards and commemoration\n\nHunt published an autobiography in 1905.  Many of his late writings are attempts to control the interpretation of his work. That year, he was appointed to the Order of Merit by King Edward VII. At the end of his life he lived in Sonning-on-Thames.\n\nHis personal life was the subject of Diana Holman-Hunt\'s book My Grandfather, his Life and Loves. \n\nThe Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was depicted in two BBC period dramas. The first, The Love School, in 1975, starred Bernard Lloyd as Hunt. The second was Desperate Romantics, in which Hunt is played by Rafe Spall. \n\nFacing Mar Elias Monastery is a stone bench erected by the wife of the painter, who painted some of his major works at this spot. The bench is inscribed with biblical verses in Hebrew, Greek, Arabic and English.\n\nPartial list of works\n\n*A Converted British Family Sheltering a Christian Missionary from the Persecution of the Druids (1850)\n*Valentine Rescuing Sylvia from Proteus (1851)\n*The Awakening Conscience (1853)\n*The Light of the World (1854)\n*The Scapegoat (1856)\n*The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple (1860)\n*The Shadow of Death (1871)\n*The Importunate Neighbour (1895)\n*The Miracle of the Holy Fire (1899)\n\nGallery\n\nFile:William Holman Hunt - Christ and the two Marys - Google Art Project.jpg|Christ and the two Marys (1847 & 1897)\nFile:William Holman Hunt 001.jpg|The Hireling Shepherd (1851)\nFile:William Holman Hunt - The Lantern Maker\'s Courtship, A Street Scene in Cairo - Google Art Project.jpg| The Lantern Maker\'s Courtship, A Street Scene in Cairo (1854–56)\nFile:William Holman Hunt - Portrait of Fanny Holman Hunt.jpg|Portrait of Fanny Holman Hunt, (1866–67)\nFile:Basilpot.jpg| Isabella and the Pot of Basil (1868)\nFile:William Holman Hunt - The Birthday.jpg| The Birthday (1868)\nFile:William Holman Hunt - Amaryllis.jpg|Amaryllis (1884)\n\nFile:Holman-Hunt, William, and Hughes, Edward Robert - The Lady of Shalott - 1905.jpg| The Lady of Shalott (1905)\nQuestion:\nWhat is the title of the painting by William Holman Hunt which features an animal with a red cloth wrapped around its horns on the Day of Atonement?\nAnswer:\nThe Scapegoat (film)\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nKing George II - Britroyals.com\nKing George II | Britroyals\nBorn: October 30, 1683 at  Herrenhausen, Hanover\nParents: George I and Sophia Dorothea\nRelation to Elizabeth II: 5th great-grandfather\nHouse of: Hanover\nAscended to the throne: June 11, 1727 aged 43 years\nCrowned: October 11, 1727 at  Westminster Abbey\nMarried: Caroline, daughter of Margrave of Brandenburg\nChildren: Four sons and five daughters\nDied: October 25, 1760 at  Kensington Palace, aged 76 years, 11 months,  and 25 days\nBuried at: Westminster\nReigned for: 33 years, 4 months,  and 15 days\nSucceeded by: his grandson George III\nGeorge II was born in Hanover the son of George I and Sophia of Celle.  He married Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach in 1705 an attractive and intelligent women, and they had 9 children.  In 1708 he took part in the Battle of Oudenarde in Belgium against the French.\nHis father became King George I of England in 1714 and he became Prince of Wales. However his father�s treatment of his mother whom he had imprisoned left son George with a hatred of his father and they regularly quarrelled.  He was even put under arrest by his father who excluded him from public ceremonies.  When his father died in 1727 he became King George II and set about changing his father�s policies. Walpole was expected to be dismissed but survived on the intervention of Queen Caroline.\nThe death of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740 led to the European War of Austrian Succession in which the British and Dutch supported Marie Theresa�s claim to the Austrian throne against the Prussians and French. George II personally led his troops at the Battle of Dettingen in 1743, becoming the last British monarch to lead his troops into battle.  The Jacobite Rebellion of 1745, in which Charles Edward Stuart (�Bonnie Prince Charlie�) landed in Scotland and marched with a Highland army into England, was defeated at Culloden in 1746 and Scottish opposition brutally suppressed by George�s second son Prince William, Duke of Cumberland. Like his father he quarrelled with his eldest son Frederick, Prince of Wales, over his marriage but Frederick died suddenly in 1751.\nThe final years of his reign saw George retiring from active politics; however it was a period in which British dominance overseas grew. William Pitt became Prime Minister during the Seven years war against France which spread to India and North America. Robert Clive secured the Indian continent for Britain at the Battle of Plassey, and General Wolfe captured Quebec in Canada.  George II died in 1760 of an aneurysm while seated on his water closet. He was succeeded by his grandson also called George.\nKing George II\'s Signature\nQuotes:\n�No I shall have mistresses� � King George II (to his wife Caroline on her death bed when she suggested that he remarry)\n�Mad, is he?

The smallest thrush may be the forest rock thrush, at 21 g and . However, the shortwings, which have ambiguous alliances with both thrushes and Old World flycatchers, can be even smaller. The lesser shortwing averages 12 cm. The largest thrush is the blue whistling thrush, at 178 g and 33 cm. The great thrush is similar in length, but less heavily built.  Most species are grey or brown in colour, often with speckled underparts.\n\nThey are insectivorous, but most species also eat worms, land snails, and fruit. Many species are permanently resident in warm climates, while others migrate to higher latitudes during summer, often over considerable distances.\n\nThrushes build cup-shaped nests, sometimes lining them with mud. They lay two to five speckled eggs, sometimes laying two or more clutches per year. Both parents help in raising the young.\n\nThe songs of some species, including members of the genera Catharus, Myadestes, Sialia and Turdus, are considered to be among the most beautiful in the avian world.  \n\nEcology\n\nTurdidae species spread the seeds of plants, contributing to the dispersal of many species and the recovery of ecosystems.\n\nPlants have limited seed dispersal mobility away from the parent plant and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time.\n\nMany bats and birds rely heavily on fruits for their diet, including birds in the families Cotingidae, Columbidae, Trogonidae, Turdidae, and Rhamphastidae. While eating fruit, these animals swallow seeds and then later regurgitate them or pass them in their faeces. Such ornithochory has been a major mechanism of seed dispersal across ocean barriers.\n\nOther seeds may stick to the feet or feathers of birds, and in this way may travel long distances. Seeds of grasses, spores of algae, and the eggs of molluscs and other invertebrates commonly establish in remote areas after long journeys of this sort. The Turdidae  have a great ecological importance because some populations migrate long distances and disperse the seeds of endangered plant species at new sites, helping to eliminate inbreeding and increasing the genetic diversity of local flora.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nThe taxonomic treatment of this large family has varied significantly in recent years. Traditionally, the Turdidae included the small Old World species, like the nightingale and European robin in the subfamily Saxicolinae, but most authorities now place this group in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae.\n\nThe family formerly included more species. At the time of the publication of the third edition of Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World in 2003, the genera Myophonus, Alethe, Brachypteryx and Monticola were included in Turdidae. Subsequent molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the species in these four genera are more closely related to species in the family Muscicapidae. As a consequence, these four genera are now placed in Muscicapidae. In contrast, the genus Cochoa which had previously been placed in Muscicapidae was shown to belong in Turdidae.\n\nGenera\n\nFAMILY: TURDIDAE\n* Genus Neocossyphus: rufous thrushes (four species) – related to Myadestes\n* Genus Geokichla: (21 species)\n* Genus Zoothera: Asian thrushes (some 15 species, one recently extinct)\n* Genus Ixoreus: varied thrush – related to other New World genera\n* Genus Ridgwayia: Aztec thrush – related to Hylocichla\n* Genus Cataponera: Sulawesi thrush\n\n* Genus Grandala: grandala\n* Genus Sialia: bluebirds (three species)\n* Genus Myadestes: solitaires (10–11 living species, two or three recently extinct, includes formerly recognized genus Phaeornis)\n* Genus Cichlopsis: rufous-brown solitaire – related to Catharus\n* Genus Catharus: typical American thrushes and nightingale-thrushes (12 species)\n* Genus Hylocichla: wood thrush\n* Genus Entomodestes: solitaires (2 species) – related to Catharus\n* Genus Turdus: true thrushes (some 65 species, one recently extinct)\n* Genus Cochoa: cochoas (four species)\n* Genus Chlamydochaera: fruithunter\n\n* Genus Platycichla: (two species) – part of a South American group within Turdus\n* Genus Nesocichla: Tristan thrush or starchy – part of a South American group within Turdus\n\n* Genus Cichlherminia: forest thrush – genus paraphyletic with Turdus\n\n* Genus Psophocichla: groundscraper thrush\n\nNow usually considered a distinct family distantly related to Picathartes:\n\n* Genus Chaetops: rock-jumpers (two species)\n\nFor other species previously in the Turdidae, see Muscicapidae and chats.\nQuestion:\nIf a bird is described as \'Turdoid\', to which family does it belong?\nAnswer:\nMan from uncle\nPassage:\nMarcus Chamat\nMarcus Chamat (pronounced shuh-mat) (born 6 May 1975, in Borlange, Sweden) is a professional eight-ball and nine-ball pool player. And while his physical stature is on the shorter side (5\'4"", 163\xa0cm) he is tall on personality and drive, earning him the nickname ""Little Napoleon"" by his friends and foes alike. He is also a co-owner of Interpool Club in Galve, Sweden which is on the East coast of the country, Galve is a very picturesque town known for its Straw Goat and wooden buildings among other things.\n\nHe plays on the International Pool Tour and has represented Team Europe at the Mosconi Cup five times.\n\nHis highest-profile title win was the World Summit of Pool in 2005. He won this event by defeating Corey Deuel in the finals.\nQuestion:\nNicknamed Napoleon, Marcus Chamat has represented Europe in which sport?\nAnswer:\nPooling (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nPolyphagia\nPolyphagia or hyperphagia is excessive hunger or increased appetite.   It derives from the Greek words πολύς (polys) which means ""very much"" or ""many"", and φαγῶ (phago) meaning ""eating"" or ""devouring"".\n\nIn medicine \n\nIn medicine, polyphagia (sometimes known as hyperphagia) is a medical sign meaning excessive hunger and abnormally large intake of solids by mouth. It can be caused by disorders such as diabetes, Kleine–Levin syndrome (a malfunction in the hypothalamus), and the genetic disorders Prader–Willi syndrome and Bardet–Biedl syndrome. \n\nCauses \n\nCauses of increased appetite include: \n\n* Anxiety\n* Depression\n* Certain drugs \n* Diabetes mellitus \n* Hyperthyroidism\n* Hypoglycemia\n* Premenstrual syndrome\n* Prader-Willi syndrome\n* Bulimia\n* Graves\' disease\n*Kleine–Levin syndrome\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis \n\nPolyphagia usually occurs early in the course of diabetic ketoacidosis.   However, once insulin deficiency becomes more severe and ketoacidosis develops, appetite is suppressed.\nQuestion:\nIn humans, Polyphagia is an excessive desire to do what?\nAnswer:\nFood consumption\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nWorcester & Birmingham Canal. | Canal & River Trust\nWorcester & Birmingham Canal | Canal & River Trust\nOur canal & river network\nWorcester & Birmingham Canal\nThe Worcester & Birmingham Canal takes you from the vibrant centre of Birmingham, through the green hills of Worcestershire, to the cathedral city of Worcester.\nWorcester & Birmingham Canal at night\nFind events and activities within\nmiles of\nAt its northern end, the canal joins the\xa0Birmingham Canal Main Line at Gas Street Basin. This pretty basin was once a thriving transport hub. Now, traditional narrowboats and elegant black and white iron footbridges sit side-by-side with modern bars and restaurants. Close by is luxury shopping centre the Mailbox, with its stylish clothing shops and cafes.\xa0\nAmong the cargos that once travelled on the canal was chocolate crumb\xa0to the Cadbury factory. Today, this is Cadbury World, a great day out if you have a sweet tooth.\nChocolate and guillotines\nAt Kings Norton Junction, the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal joins under permanently open guillotine gates. Opposite the junction is an attractive toll house with its board showing the charges.\nThe Lickey Hills are pierced by three long tunnels. The canal was realigned to allow the building of the M42. Tardebigge Wharf, with its dry dock, maintenance yard, workers\' cottages, and historic warehouse remains the main base for maintenance on the canal, and is a great place to start a walk.\xa0 It was here that Tom Rolt met Robert Aickman, which led to the creation of the Inland Waterways Association.\nHistoric meeting\nAll 58 locks are in the second half of the canal, as the canal descends through rural Worcestershire. The Tardebigge lock flight has 30 locks in just over two miles, making it the longest in the country.\nHanbury Hall (National Trust) can easily be reached by a pleasant walk across the fields from Astwood Bottom Lock. Hanbury Junction marks the connection with the Droitwich Junction Canal, linked with the Droitwich Barge Canal and offers a route to the River Severn\xa0at Hawford. You might like to take a short walk down the Hanbury Flight, which was rebuilt by volunteers. Hanbury\'s other claim to fame is that it is said to be the real-life counterpart of Radio 4\'s Ambridge, home of The Archers.\nAround Bilford, the countryside is left behind as the canal begins to encroach on the city environs. The Commandery was the headquarters of Charles Stuart before the Battle of Worcester in 1651.\nAhead lies Diglis Basins and two wide locks accessing the Severn. Once very busy with commercial traffic, the working boats have long been replaced by pleasure craft. Worcester Cathedral stares down imposingly on travellers entering the river.\nBoating\nThe Worcester & Birmingham Canal is a justifiably popular cruising route and is now part of both the Avon and Stourport Cruising Rings. With 58 locks in all it is well suited to energetic crews, or those who don\'t mind taking their time.\nDownload Worcester & Birmingham Canal towpath guidance for cyclists\nThe history\nThe purpose of the Worcester & Birmingham Canal was to give a much shorter link between Birmingham and the river Severn.\xa0Against opposition from other canals, it obtained its Act in 1791.\xa0Construction started at the Birmingham end but progress was slow.\xa0The canal was intended to be broad (for boats up to 14ft wide), which is why the first three tunnels have this width, but shortage of money meant that the section from Tardebigge to Worcester was built only wide enough for narrow boats.\xa0It opened throughout in 1815.\nWater supply was a major problem and a source of conflict with connecting canals.\xa0 At first the Birmingham Canal and the W&B were physically separated by what was known as Worcester Bar, but in 1815 they agreed a compromise whereby the two canals would be linked by a lock, with the W&B paying a compensation toll for all traffic passing through.\nThe guillotine lock by Kings Norton Junction on the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal enabled each canal to preserve its water, regardless of the respective levels.\nExperimental vertical boat lift\nTardebigge top lock is particularly deep because it was the site of a experimental vertical boat lift, which proved not to be robust enough.\xa0 After a few months it was replaced by a conventional lock — but as a canal’s water usage is largely determined by its deepest lock, it would have been better if it had been replaced by two locks.\xa0\nThe volume of traffic never lived up to expectations, though it improved once the Gloucester & Berkeley Canal opened in 1827. Salt had been found when the canal was being cut at Stoke Prior, and the industry which developed became an important source of traffic.\xa0 Worcester gas works and other canalside industries used coal brought by the canal.\nRailway competition\nHowever, from 1841 railway competition took away much of the business and in 1868 losses were so severe that a receiver was appointed. The canal was saved by being bought in 1874 by the Sharpness New Docks Company (which by then owned the Gloucester & Sharpness Canal). Under enterprising management new traffic was sought, and the canal survived until nationalisation in 1948.\nThe last commercial traffics were coal from Cannock to Worcester and chocolate crumb from Worcester to Bourneville, ceasing in 1960 and 1961 respectively.\nQuestion:\nThe English cities of Gloucester and Worcester are on which river?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 3497, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 3497, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 6}]",1,0.8333333333333334,21458,21458.0,356.46,15,15.0,0.25,6,0.02,1,39.08981683999991,ml.g5.48xlarge,llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235,meta-textgeneration-llama-2-70b-2024-01-20-17-53-55-754,763104351884.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference:2.0.1-tgi1.1.0-gpu-py39-cu118-ubuntu20.04,s3://jumpstart-private-cache-prod-us-east-1/meta-textgeneration/meta-textgeneration-llama-2-70b/artifacts/inference-prepack/v1.0.0/,3600,/opt/ml/model,4095,4096,/opt/ml/model,1,1,inference.py,8,,,,

It is constructed in accordance with a detailed set of specifications published by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Its overall length must be at least 260 cm (102.4 inches) and its weight at least 800 grams (1.8 pounds). The women’s javelin is somewhat shorter and lighter—a minimum 220 cm (86.6 inches) long and 600 grams (1.3 pounds) in weight.\nJavelin throw, side view.\nEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.\nAfter a short run, the javelin is thrown directly forward with an over-the-shoulder motion into a 29° sector marked on the field. It must land point first. The thrower’s body may not rotate a full turn (360°) before the javelin is released, and he may not step on or beyond a line at the end of the runway.\nScandinavian athletes dominated the first 50 years of men’s javelin competition. Sweden conducted the first national championship in the event in 1896, and Swedish and Finnish athletes held most world records until 1953. The javelin throw has been an Olympic event since 1908; a women’s javelin event was added to the Olympic program in 1932.\nLearn More in these related articles:\nQuestion:\nWhat Olympic event involves throwing a spear?\nAnswer:\nAkontion\nPassage:\nA Harlot\'s Progress\nA Harlot\'s Progress (also known as The Harlot\'s Progress) is a series of six paintings (1731, now destroyed) and engravings (1732) by the English artist William Hogarth. The series shows the story of a young woman, M. (Moll or Mary) Hackabout, who arrives in London from the country and becomes a prostitute. The series was developed from the third image: having painted a prostitute in her boudoir in a garret on Drury Lane, Hogarth struck upon the idea of creating scenes from her earlier and later life. The title and rich allegory are reminiscent of John Bunyan\'s Pilgrim\'s Progress.\n\nIn the first scene, an old woman praises her beauty and suggests a profitable occupation, procuring her for the gentleman shown towards the back of the image. She is a mistress with two lovers in the second, has become a common prostitute on the point of being arrested in the third, and is beating hemp in Bridewell Prison in the fourth. By the fifth, she is dying from venereal disease, and she is dead aged only 23 in the last.\n\nHistory\n\nThe protagonist ""M. Hackabout"" (see Plate 1, Plate 3, and the coffin-lid in Plate 6, which reads: ""M. Hackabout Died Sepr 2d 1731 Aged 23"") is either named after the heroine of Moll Flanders and Kate Hackabout or ironically after the Blessed Virgin Mary.  Kate was a notorious prostitute and the sister of highwayman Francis Hackabout: he was hanged on 17 April 1730; she was convicted of keeping a disorderly house in August the same year, having been arrested by Westminster magistrate Sir John Gonson.\n\nThe series of paintings proved to be very popular and Hogarth used his experience as an apprentice to a silversmith to create engravings of the images, selling a ""limited edition"" of 1,240 sets of six prints to subscribers for a Guinea. Pirate copies of the engravings were soon in circulation, and Hogarth procured a 1735 Act of Parliament (8 Geo. II. cap. 13) to prohibit the practice. Soon after, Hogarth published his second series of satirical and moralistic images, A Rake\'s Progress, followed some years later by Marriage à-la-mode.\n\nThe original paintings were destroyed in a fire at Fonthill House in 1755, the country house of William Beckford (1709–1770), a politician and father of William Thomas Beckford (1 October 1760 – 2 May 1844) builder of Fonthill Abbey in Wiltshire. The original plates survived, and were sold by Hogarth\'s widow, Jane, to John Boydell in 1789; by him to Baldwin, Cradock and Joy in 1818; and then to Henry Bohn in 1835. Each produced further copies.\n\nAdaptation\n\nBritish composer Iain Bell composed an operatic adaptation of the work which opened at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna in 2013 with German soprano Diana Damrau in the title role. The world premiere of the opera A Harlot\'s Progress was on 13 October 2013. \n\nThe plates\nQuestion:\n‘The Harlot’s Progress’ is a series of paintings and engravings by which 18th Century English painter?\nAnswer:\nHogarthian\nPassage:\nCentral London\nCentral London is the innermost part of London, England. There is no official definition of its area, but its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. Over time a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics, urban planning and local government. \n\nRoad distances to London are traditionally measured from a central point at Charing Cross (in the City of Westminster), which is marked by the statue of King Charles I at the junction of the Strand, Whitehall and Cockspur Street, just south of Trafalgar Square. \n\nCharacteristics\n\nDefinitions\n\nLondon Plan\n\nThe London Plan defines the ""Central Activities Zone"" policy area, which comprises the City of London, most of Westminster and the inner parts of Camden, Islington, Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Lambeth and Kensington and Chelsea.  It is described as ""a unique cluster of vitally important activities including central government offices, headquarters and embassies, the largest concentration of London\'s financial and business services sector and the offices of trade, professional bodies, institutions, associations, communications, publishing, advertising and the media"". \n\nFor strategic planning, since 2011 there has been a Central London sub region comprising the boroughs of Camden, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Southwark, Westminster and the City of London.  From 2004 to 2008, the London Plan included a sub-region called Central London comprising Camden, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Southwark, Wandsworth and Westminster. It had a 2001 population of 1,525,000. The sub-region was replaced in 2008 with a new structure which amalgamated inner and outer boroughs together. This was altered in 2011 when a new Central London sub region was created, now including the City of London and excluding Wandsworth. However, districts at the outer edge of this subregion such as Streatham, Dulwich and Holloway are not generally considered as Central London.\n\nCensus\n\nThe 1901 census defined Central London as the City of London and the metropolitan boroughs of Bermondsey, Bethnal Green, Finsbury, Holborn, Shoreditch, Southwark, Stepney, St Marylebone and Westminster. \n\n1959–1963 proposals for a Central London borough\n\nDuring the Herbert Commission and the subsequent passage of the London Government Bill, three attempts were made to define an area that would form a central London borough. The first two were detailed in the 1959 Memorandum of Evidence of the Greater London Group of the London School of Economics. \n\n\'Scheme A\' envisaged a central London borough, one of 25, consisting of the City of London, Westminster, Holborn, Finsbury and the inner parts of St Marylebone, St Pancras, Chelsea, Southwark and Lambeth. The boundary deviated from existing lines in order to include all central London railway stations, the Tower of London and the museums, such that it included small parts of Kensington, Shoreditch, Stepney and Bermondsey. It had an estimated population of 350,000 and occupied 7000 acre. \n\n\'Scheme B\' delineated central London, as one of 7 boroughs, including most of the City of London, the whole of Finsbury and Holborn, most of Westminster and Southwark, parts of St Pancras, St Marylebone, Paddington and a small part of Kensington. The area had an estimated population of 400,000 and occupied 8000 acre.\n\nDuring the passage of the London Government Bill an amendment was put forward to create a central borough corresponding to the definition used at the 1961 census. It consisted of the City of London, all of Westminster, Holborn and Finsbury; and the inner parts of Shoreditch, Stepney, Bermondsey, Southwark, Lambeth, Chelsea, Kensington, Paddington, St Marylebone and St Pancras. The population was estimated to be 270,000.\nQuestion:\nWhat central London street is famous for containing the main government offices?\nAnswer:\nVerge of the Palaces of St James and Whitehall\nPassage:\nEra (geology)\nA geologic era is a subdivision of geologic time that divides an eon into smaller units of time. The Phanerozoic Eon is divided into three such time frames: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic represent the major stages in the macroscopic fossil record. These eras are separated by catastrophic extinction boundaries, the P-T boundary between the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic and the K-T boundary between the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic. There is evidence that catastrophic meteorite impacts played a role in demarcating the differences between the eras.\n\nThe Hadean, Archean and Proterozoic eons were as a whole formerly called the Precambrian. This covered the four billion years of Earth history prior to the appearance of hard-shelled animals. More recently, however, those eons have been subdivided into eras of their own.\n\nList of geological eras in Earth\'s evolutionary history\nQuestion:\nWhich geological era, spanning the massive time-period between 245 million and 65 million years ago, is divided into three periods named the Triassic, the Jurassic and the Cretaceous ?\nAnswer:\nTHE MESOZOIC ERA\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nfagot - Wiktionary\nfagot - Wiktionary\nfagot\nWhat fool hath added water to the sea, \\ Or brought a fagot to bright-burning Troy?\nAlternative form of faggot (shrivelled old woman)\nAlternative form of faggot (a gay person, particularly a man)\nA bundle of pieces of wrought iron to be worked over into bars or other shapes by rolling or hammering at a welding heat; a pile .\n(music, obsolete ) A fagotto , or bassoon .\n( Britain , obsolete ) A person hired to take the place of another at the muster of a company .\n(Can we find and add a quotation of Addison to this entry?)\nQuestion:\nWhich musical instrument has an Italian name fagotto which means a \'bundle of sticks\'?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 3003, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 3003, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 6}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

The song became the group\'s international breakthrough single, receiving recognition around the world. It was their first Top 10 hit on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 10. The song also  peaked at number 11 in Australia, and achieved success in Japan and America. \n\nThe song was written by frontman Fran Healy who wrote the song while on holiday in Israel. He wanted to go somewhere sunny because in his hometown of Glasgow it rained all the time. In an interview at the Live 8 concert, he explained that he was spending a short holiday in the southern vacation city of Eilat, Israel in the middle of the winter.  The city is known for its hot weather even during winter time, but surprisingly it began to rain for two days during his stay. \n\nWhen Travis began to perform this song at the 1999 Glastonbury Festival, after being sunny for several hours, it began to rain exactly when the first line was sung.\n\nIn a poll by listeners of Absolute Radio the song was ranked 39th on a list of the top 100 songs of the 1990s.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe music video was directed by John Hardwick and filmed in Cornwall, with scenes filmed on Craddock Moor. The pool of water that the band jump into is part of a disused mining quarry known locally as ""Gold Digger\'s Mine"". The video features the band in a rain-soaked setting, with the band having locked frontman Healy, wearing a kilt, in the boot of a 1970s Vauxhall Viva. Healy escapes, and chases the rest of the band into a disused mining quarry. The video continues with the band being shown in a floating living room, performing the song. The video ends with the living room floating away.

It is recommended to be used only after other measures, such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction, have not improved cholesterol levels.\n\nThe evidence for the use of pravastatin is generally weaker than for other statins. The antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment to prevent heart attack trial (ALLHAT), failed to demonstrate a difference in all-cause mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction/fatal coronary heart disease rates between patients receiving pravastatin 40 mg daily (a common starting dose) and those receiving usual care. \n\nAdverse effects and contraindications\n\nPravastatin has undergone over 112,000 patient-years of double-blind, randomized trials using the 40-mg, once-daily dose and placebos. These trials indicate pravastatin is well tolerated and displays few noncardiovascular abnormalities in patients.   However, side effects may occur. A doctor should be consulted if symptoms such as heartburn or headache are severe and do not go away.\n\nThese uncommon side effects should be promptly reported to the prescribing doctor or an emergency medical service: \n* muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness\n* lack of energy\n* fever\n* jaundice, yellowing of the skin or eyes\n* pain in the upper right part of the stomach\n* nausea\n* extreme tiredness\n* unusual bleeding or bruising\n* dark-colored urine\n* loss of appetite\n* flu-like symptoms\n* rash\n* hives\n* itching\n* difficulty breathing or swallowing\n* swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs\n* hoarseness\n\nThese symptoms should be reported to the prescribing doctor if they persist or increase in severity:\n* heartburn\n* headache\n* memory loss or forgetfulness\n* confusion\n\nContraindications, conditions that warrant withholding treatment with pravastatin, include pregnancy and breastfeeding. Taking pravastatin while pregnant could lead to birth defects. While the amount of pravastatin ingested by an infant from breastfeeding is low, patients breastfeeding should not take pravastatin due to potential effects on the infant\'s lipid metabolism.\n\nDrug interactions\n\nMedications that should not be taken with pravastatin include, but are not limited to:\n* Cimetidine (Tagamet) \n* Colchicine (Colcrys)\n* Cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune)\n* Ketoconazole (Nizoral)\n* Additional cholesterol-lowering medications such as: fenofibrate (Tricor), gemfibrozil (Lopid), cholestyramine (Questran, Questran Light, Cholybar), and niacin (nicotinic acid, Niacor, Niaspan);\n* Specific HIV protease inhibitors such as: lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra), and ritonavir (Norvir) taken with darunavir (Prezista); and spironolactone (Aldactone).\n\nPravastatin is cleared by the kidney, giving it a distinct advantage over other statins when a potential for drug interactions using the hepatic pathway exists.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nPravastatin acts as a lipoprotein-lowering drug through two pathways. In the major pathway, pravastatin inhibits the function of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. As a reversible competitive inhibitor, pravastatin sterically hinders the action of HMG-CoA reductase by occupying the active site of the enzyme. Taking place primarily in the liver, this enzyme is responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate in the rate-limiting step of the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol. Pravastatin also inhibits the synthesis of very-low-density lipoproteins, which are the precursor to low-density lipoproteins (LDL). These reductions increase the number of cellular LDL receptors, thus LDL uptake increases, removing it from the bloodstream.  Overall, the result is a reduction in circulating cholesterol and LDL. A minor reduction in triglycerides and an increase in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are common.\n\nHistory\n\nInitially known as CS-514, pravastatin is a derivative of ML236B (compactin), which was identified in a fungus called Penicillium citrinum in the 1970s by researchers of the Sankyo Pharma Inc.Jonathan A. Tobert  [http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v2/n7/full/nrd1112.html Lovastatin and beyond: the history of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors] Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2, 517-526 (July 2003) PMID 12815379  It is being marketed outside Japan by the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb. In 2005, Pravachol was the 22nd-highest selling brand-name drug in the United States, with sales totaling $1.3 billion. \n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved generic pravastatin for sale in the United States for the first time on April 24, 2006. Generic pravastatin sodium tablets are manufactured by Biocon Ltd, India and TEVA Pharmaceuticals in Kfar Sava, Israel.\nQuestion:\nPravachol, Lipitor, Mevacor, Altocor, and Zocor are brands of what $multi-billion cholesterol controlling drug, ultimately named after Greek meaning \'causing to stand\'?\nAnswer:\nCholesterol Reduction\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nGORDON JACKSON, 66; WAS BUTLER IN SERIES \'UPSTAIRS ...\nGORDON JACKSON, 66; WAS BUTLER IN SERIES \'UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS\' - The Boston Globe (Boston, MA) | HighBeam Research\nAPA\nAssociated Press.

Hucknall achieved international fame in the 1980s as the lead singer and songwriter of the soul-influenced pop band Simply Red, with whom he enjoyed a 25-year career and sold over 50 million albums. Hucknall is recognisable for his smooth, distinctive voice and wide vocal range, as well as his red curly hair, and has been described as ""one of the truly great blue-eyed soul singers"". \n\nEarly life\n\nHucknall, born at St Mary\'s Hospital, Manchester,   was an only child. His mother abandoned the family when he was three; the upheaval caused by this event inspired him to write ""Holding Back the Years,"" which would become one of Simply Red\'s biggest and best-known hits. He was brought up by his father, Reginald (1935–2009),  a barber in Stockport.  He attended Audenshaw School.  It would not be until the mid-1990s that he would finally reconnect with his mother, Maureen, who was by then living in Dallas. As of a 2008 interview, he had only seen her on two occasions since she first abandoned the family. \n\nMusic career \n\nHucknall was among the people present at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester in June 1976 where the Sex Pistols were playing.  His interest in the music scene led to the launch of his career in the late 1970s, when he was part of the formation of the band Frantic Elevators.\n\nThe Frantic Elevators released four singles, including a version of ""Holding Back the Years"", which he later recorded with Simply Red.\n\nAs lead singer and core member of Simply Red, he became the identifiable face of the band. His face and long curly red hair were featured prominently on album artwork and in videos.\n\nHucknall is also one of the founders and financial backers of the successful reggae label Blood and Fire. He also manages the record label simplyred.com.\n\nIn October 2007, on David Jensen\'s show on the Gold network, he announced Simply Red would split in 2009. \n\nIn 2008 Hucknall released his first solo album Tribute to Bobby, a tribute to the blues musician Bobby ""Blue"" Bland. \n\nIn June 2009, Hucknall took part in Songbook as part of the Sky Arts series, whereby music artists reflect on their favourite compositions and their background history in music.\n\nIn October 2009, Mick appeared at a charity performance as vocalist for a re-formed version of Faces, replacing Rod Stewart. In May 2010, it was announced that the new Faces line-up with Mick as frontman would be performing festival shows in 2010, followed by a world tour in 2011. \n\nIn October 2012, he released American Soul, a collection of his favourite music re-recorded with his vocals. During a series of interviews promoting the American Soul album, Hucknall revealed that he has also been working on an album of original material, to be released after American Soul has reached the end of its life cycle.\n\nPolitics \n\nHucknall is active in politics and is a prominent celebrity supporter of the UK Labour Party. In 1997, he declared his support for the Labour Party at that year\'s general election – which it won by a landslide under the leadership of Tony Blair to return to government after 18 years in opposition.  In 1998 Hucknall was named in a list of those who donated more than £5,000 to the party.  In 2003, Hucknall backed Tony Blair\'s stance on Operation Iraqi Freedom, claiming he had ""more respect for Blair than ever"" and pointed out that British critics of the war were lucky to be living in a country where they could express their opinions. However, he claimed in 2008 that his conscience prevented him from donating to the party again because of the war, although he would still vote for them. \n\nHucknall has commented that derogatory references to his red hair are a form of bigotry. \n\nHucknall was a guest on the panel for the BBC\'s political discussion series Question Time, broadcast on 27 March 2014, and declared his support for same-sex marriage. \n\nPersonal life\n\nHucknall and his partner, Gabriella Wesberry, had a daughter, Romy True Hucknall, in June 2007.  Hucknall and Wesberry married in 2010, at the 16th-century Forter Castle in Glenisla, Perthshire, Scotland.  He spends a considerable amount of time in Ireland, where he purchased the Glenmore Estate near the village of Cloghan, County Donegal, with bandmate Chris De Margary. Hucknall and De Margary are keen fishermen, and operate a fishing and hunting tourism business from the estate.  \n\nHe co-owns Ask Property Development, a company that constructs city squares and public buildings. \n\nHe spends much time in Catania, Sicily, where he produces wines under the label ""Il Cantante"" (The Singer). \n\nHucknall is a Manchester United fan. \n\nHe has dated a handful of celebrities throughout his career.  In 2010, Hucknall admitted that in his most successful years, between 1985 and 1987, he would have sex with about three women a day and described himself as a sex addict. \n\nSolo discography\n\nAlbums\n\nSingles\n\nOther appearances\n\nIn 1986, he provided backup vocals for the musical film Little Shop of Horrors.\nQuestion:\nWhat is Mick Hucknell\'s band?\nAnswer:\nSimply Red\nPassage:\nThe Absinthe Drinker - Pablo Picasso - WikiArt.org ...\nThe Absinthe Drinker, 1901 - Pablo Picasso - WikiArt.org\nThe Absinthe Drinker\nit is a historically significant artwork\nthe image is only being used for informational and educational purposes\nthe image is readily available on the internet\nthe image is a low resolution copy of the original artwork and is unsuitable for commercial use\nMore …\nWikiArt.org allows unlimited copying, distributing and displaying of the images of public domain artworks solely.

Merrie Melodies cartoon, directed by Robert McKimson and written by Tedd Pierce starring Bennie the fat cat and George. It was animated in 1952. Voices by Mel Blanc and music by Carl Stalling. It was the first appearance of Speedy Gonzales, in a prototype form.  Because this cartoon\'s rendition of Speedy Gonzales looked rather coarse, they redesigned him for future cartoon releases.\n\nPlot\n\nThe two cats pursuing Speedy in Cat-Tails for Two are the slow-witted (and injury-causing) Benny and the fully functioning but unfortunate George, both patterned after the characters Lennie and George in the novel Of Mice and Men. George and Benny are walking down a pier looking for food, when they find a Mexican ship. Figuring the ship will have plenty of Mexican mice, i.e. ""Mexican food"" (Benny: ""It gives me the heartburn and I love it!""), they climb on, only to find an unkempt mouse calling himself ""Speedy Gonzales: Fastest Mouse in All Mexico"".\n\nGeorge and Benny go through numerous attempts to capture Speedy, who always outwits them. Speedy comes to think of them as private entertainment, at one point declaring ""I like those fellows. All the time having fon (fun)!"" Among the cats\' failed attempts:\n\n1. A crate full of ""Acme Anvils"" set above a piece of cheese. With Benny holding the rope and George setting the bait, Speedy gives Benny a scare from behind, causing him to let go of the rope and the crate to flatten George. As punishment, George swings down on Benny\'s cranium with a mallet, but the mallet bounces off Benny\'s head right on top of his own! When Benny asks ""Why did you hit yourself on the head for, George?"", the slap-happy cat answers: ""I like it, I like it!!""\n\n2. George sets up seven pieces of cheese with dynamite-stick booby traps throughout the ship, but doesn\'t have a match to light the sticks. Speedy taunts George with a match and sets him up to take the explosions. Benny comes to the rescue by cooling George down, but misinterprets a bucket of petrol as ""a funny way to spell \'water\'"" leaving him half furless.\n\n3. A pipe with one end disguised as an entranceway to a cabaret and Benny standing at the other end with a mallet. When Speedy enters the pipe, George fires a skyrocket in behind him, the idea being to force Speedy out into the path of the mallet. But the rocket unexpectedly yanks George through the pipe behind it. Speedy is too fast for Benny, and Benny ends up clobbering George when he is pulled out the other side turning his head into a mallet size.\n\nFinally, the two cats run a pipe into Speedy\'s hiding place (to the tune of Raymond Scott\'s Powerhouse), but Speedy grabs a wrench and bends the pipe back around to the cats, unbeknownst to them. George starts shoving a lot of dynamite into the pipe, resulting in a mountain of TNT piling up behind him and Benny. When George is done shoving dynamite through the pipe, he lights the last stick with a match, and the mountain of dynamite blasts him and Benny up into the air. As they descend, Benny asks George about their Mexican dinner, with George responding ""I kind of lost my appetite for Mexican food,"" before both cats plunge into the harbor. A smug Speedy looks at the camera and declares ""I love those fellows. They\'re so see-lee (silly)!""

It is constructed in accordance with a detailed set of specifications published by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Its overall length must be at least 260 cm (102.4 inches) and its weight at least 800 grams (1.8 pounds). The women’s javelin is somewhat shorter and lighter—a minimum 220 cm (86.6 inches) long and 600 grams (1.3 pounds) in weight.\nJavelin throw, side view.\nEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.\nAfter a short run, the javelin is thrown directly forward with an over-the-shoulder motion into a 29° sector marked on the field. It must land point first. The thrower’s body may not rotate a full turn (360°) before the javelin is released, and he may not step on or beyond a line at the end of the runway.\nScandinavian athletes dominated the first 50 years of men’s javelin competition. Sweden conducted the first national championship in the event in 1896, and Swedish and Finnish athletes held most world records until 1953. The javelin throw has been an Olympic event since 1908; a women’s javelin event was added to the Olympic program in 1932.\nLearn More in these related articles:\nQuestion:\nWhat Olympic event involves throwing a spear?\nAnswer:\nAkontion\nPassage:\nA Harlot\'s Progress\nA Harlot\'s Progress (also known as The Harlot\'s Progress) is a series of six paintings (1731, now destroyed) and engravings (1732) by the English artist William Hogarth. The series shows the story of a young woman, M. (Moll or Mary) Hackabout, who arrives in London from the country and becomes a prostitute. The series was developed from the third image: having painted a prostitute in her boudoir in a garret on Drury Lane, Hogarth struck upon the idea of creating scenes from her earlier and later life. The title and rich allegory are reminiscent of John Bunyan\'s Pilgrim\'s Progress.\n\nIn the first scene, an old woman praises her beauty and suggests a profitable occupation, procuring her for the gentleman shown towards the back of the image. She is a mistress with two lovers in the second, has become a common prostitute on the point of being arrested in the third, and is beating hemp in Bridewell Prison in the fourth. By the fifth, she is dying from venereal disease, and she is dead aged only 23 in the last.\n\nHistory\n\nThe protagonist ""M. Hackabout"" (see Plate 1, Plate 3, and the coffin-lid in Plate 6, which reads: ""M. Hackabout Died Sepr 2d 1731 Aged 23"") is either named after the heroine of Moll Flanders and Kate Hackabout or ironically after the Blessed Virgin Mary.  Kate was a notorious prostitute and the sister of highwayman Francis Hackabout: he was hanged on 17 April 1730; she was convicted of keeping a disorderly house in August the same year, having been arrested by Westminster magistrate Sir John Gonson.\n\nThe series of paintings proved to be very popular and Hogarth used his experience as an apprentice to a silversmith to create engravings of the images, selling a ""limited edition"" of 1,240 sets of six prints to subscribers for a Guinea. Pirate copies of the engravings were soon in circulation, and Hogarth procured a 1735 Act of Parliament (8 Geo. II. cap. 13) to prohibit the practice. Soon after, Hogarth published his second series of satirical and moralistic images, A Rake\'s Progress, followed some years later by Marriage à-la-mode.\n\nThe original paintings were destroyed in a fire at Fonthill House in 1755, the country house of William Beckford (1709–1770), a politician and father of William Thomas Beckford (1 October 1760 – 2 May 1844) builder of Fonthill Abbey in Wiltshire. The original plates survived, and were sold by Hogarth\'s widow, Jane, to John Boydell in 1789; by him to Baldwin, Cradock and Joy in 1818; and then to Henry Bohn in 1835. Each produced further copies.\n\nAdaptation\n\nBritish composer Iain Bell composed an operatic adaptation of the work which opened at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna in 2013 with German soprano Diana Damrau in the title role. The world premiere of the opera A Harlot\'s Progress was on 13 October 2013. \n\nThe plates\nQuestion:\n‘The Harlot’s Progress’ is a series of paintings and engravings by which 18th Century English painter?\nAnswer:\nHogarthian\nPassage:\nCentral London\nCentral London is the innermost part of London, England. There is no official definition of its area, but its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. Over time a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics, urban planning and local government. \n\nRoad distances to London are traditionally measured from a central point at Charing Cross (in the City of Westminster), which is marked by the statue of King Charles I at the junction of the Strand, Whitehall and Cockspur Street, just south of Trafalgar Square. \n\nCharacteristics\n\nDefinitions\n\nLondon Plan\n\nThe London Plan defines the ""Central Activities Zone"" policy area, which comprises the City of London, most of Westminster and the inner parts of Camden, Islington, Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Lambeth and Kensington and Chelsea.  It is described as ""a unique cluster of vitally important activities including central government offices, headquarters and embassies, the largest concentration of London\'s financial and business services sector and the offices of trade, professional bodies, institutions, associations, communications, publishing, advertising and the media"". \n\nFor strategic planning, since 2011 there has been a Central London sub region comprising the boroughs of Camden, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Southwark, Westminster and the City of London.  From 2004 to 2008, the London Plan included a sub-region called Central London comprising Camden, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Southwark, Wandsworth and Westminster. It had a 2001 population of 1,525,000. The sub-region was replaced in 2008 with a new structure which amalgamated inner and outer boroughs together. This was altered in 2011 when a new Central London sub region was created, now including the City of London and excluding Wandsworth. However, districts at the outer edge of this subregion such as Streatham, Dulwich and Holloway are not generally considered as Central London.\n\nCensus\n\nThe 1901 census defined Central London as the City of London and the metropolitan boroughs of Bermondsey, Bethnal Green, Finsbury, Holborn, Shoreditch, Southwark, Stepney, St Marylebone and Westminster. \n\n1959–1963 proposals for a Central London borough\n\nDuring the Herbert Commission and the subsequent passage of the London Government Bill, three attempts were made to define an area that would form a central London borough. The first two were detailed in the 1959 Memorandum of Evidence of the Greater London Group of the London School of Economics. \n\n\'Scheme A\' envisaged a central London borough, one of 25, consisting of the City of London, Westminster, Holborn, Finsbury and the inner parts of St Marylebone, St Pancras, Chelsea, Southwark and Lambeth. The boundary deviated from existing lines in order to include all central London railway stations, the Tower of London and the museums, such that it included small parts of Kensington, Shoreditch, Stepney and Bermondsey. It had an estimated population of 350,000 and occupied 7000 acre. \n\n\'Scheme B\' delineated central London, as one of 7 boroughs, including most of the City of London, the whole of Finsbury and Holborn, most of Westminster and Southwark, parts of St Pancras, St Marylebone, Paddington and a small part of Kensington. The area had an estimated population of 400,000 and occupied 8000 acre.\n\nDuring the passage of the London Government Bill an amendment was put forward to create a central borough corresponding to the definition used at the 1961 census. It consisted of the City of London, all of Westminster, Holborn and Finsbury; and the inner parts of Shoreditch, Stepney, Bermondsey, Southwark, Lambeth, Chelsea, Kensington, Paddington, St Marylebone and St Pancras. The population was estimated to be 270,000.\nQuestion:\nWhat central London street is famous for containing the main government offices?\nAnswer:\nVerge of the Palaces of St James and Whitehall\nPassage:\nEra (geology)\nA geologic era is a subdivision of geologic time that divides an eon into smaller units of time. The Phanerozoic Eon is divided into three such time frames: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic represent the major stages in the macroscopic fossil record. These eras are separated by catastrophic extinction boundaries, the P-T boundary between the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic and the K-T boundary between the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic. There is evidence that catastrophic meteorite impacts played a role in demarcating the differences between the eras.\n\nThe Hadean, Archean and Proterozoic eons were as a whole formerly called the Precambrian. This covered the four billion years of Earth history prior to the appearance of hard-shelled animals. More recently, however, those eons have been subdivided into eras of their own.\n\nList of geological eras in Earth\'s evolutionary history\nQuestion:\nWhich geological era, spanning the massive time-period between 245 million and 65 million years ago, is divided into three periods named the Triassic, the Jurassic and the Cretaceous ?\nAnswer:\nTHE MESOZOIC ERA\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nfagot - Wiktionary\nfagot - Wiktionary\nfagot\nWhat fool hath added water to the sea, \\ Or brought a fagot to bright-burning Troy?\nAlternative form of faggot (shrivelled old woman)\nAlternative form of faggot (a gay person, particularly a man)\nA bundle of pieces of wrought iron to be worked over into bars or other shapes by rolling or hammering at a welding heat; a pile .\n(music, obsolete ) A fagotto , or bassoon .\n( Britain , obsolete ) A person hired to take the place of another at the muster of a company .\n(Can we find and add a quotation of Addison to this entry?)\nQuestion:\nWhich musical instrument has an Italian name fagotto which means a \'bundle of sticks\'?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 3003, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 3003, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 6}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

The area had an estimated population of 400,000 and occupied 8000 acre.\n\nDuring the passage of the London Government Bill an amendment was put forward to create a central borough corresponding to the definition used at the 1961 census. It consisted of the City of London, all of Westminster, Holborn and Finsbury; and the inner parts of Shoreditch, Stepney, Bermondsey, Southwark, Lambeth, Chelsea, Kensington, Paddington, St Marylebone and St Pancras. The population was estimated to be 270,000.\nQuestion:\nWhat central London street is famous for containing the main government offices?\nAnswer:\nVerge of the Palaces of St James and Whitehall\nPassage:\nEra (geology)\nA geologic era is a subdivision of geologic time that divides an eon into smaller units of time. The Phanerozoic Eon is divided into three such time frames: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic represent the major stages in the macroscopic fossil record. These eras are separated by catastrophic extinction boundaries, the P-T boundary between the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic and the K-T boundary between the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic. There is evidence that catastrophic meteorite impacts played a role in demarcating the differences between the eras.\n\nThe Hadean, Archean and Proterozoic eons were as a whole formerly called the Precambrian. This covered the four billion years of Earth history prior to the appearance of hard-shelled animals. More recently, however, those eons have been subdivided into eras of their own.\n\nList of geological eras in Earth\'s evolutionary history\nQuestion:\nWhich geological era, spanning the massive time-period between 245 million and 65 million years ago, is divided into three periods named the Triassic, the Jurassic and the Cretaceous ?\nAnswer:\nTHE MESOZOIC ERA\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nfagot - Wiktionary\nfagot - Wiktionary\nfagot\nWhat fool hath added water to the sea, \\ Or brought a fagot to bright-burning Troy?\nAlternative form of faggot (shrivelled old woman)\nAlternative form of faggot (a gay person, particularly a man)\nA bundle of pieces of wrought iron to be worked over into bars or other shapes by rolling or hammering at a welding heat; a pile .\n(music, obsolete ) A fagotto , or bassoon .\n( Britain , obsolete ) A person hired to take the place of another at the muster of a company .\n(Can we find and add a quotation of Addison to this entry?)\nQuestion:\nWhich musical instrument has an Italian name fagotto which means a \'bundle of sticks\'?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 3003, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 3003, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 6}]",1,0.8333333333333334,19066,19066.0,316.62,31,31.0,0.51,6,0.02,1,51.68000525900061,ml.g5.48xlarge,llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235,meta-textgeneration-llama-2-70b-2024-01-20-17-53-55-754,763104351884.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference:2.0.1-tgi1.1.0-gpu-py39-cu118-ubuntu20.04,s3://jumpstart-private-cache-prod-us-east-1/meta-textgeneration/meta-textgeneration-llama-2-70b/artifacts/inference-prepack/v1.0.0/,3600,/opt/ml/model,4095,4096,/opt/ml/model,1,1,inference.py,8,,,,

For example, the word ""cabinet"" can mean ""storage space in your kitchen"" or ""a group of folks who advise the president."" Beer is a word with two meanings. It can mean an alcoholic beverage made from cereal grains, or a non-alcoholic beverage flavored by root extracts. Root beer, birch beer and ginger beer are three common forms of this non-alcoholic sort of beer.\nIn the case of root beer, the flavoring comes from the root of the sassafras tree or the sarsaparilla vine. Originally, the root was brewed like a tea to make an extract, but now it is much easier to buy the extract ready-made.\nUp Next\nQuestion:\nWhat do the English know American root beer as\nAnswer:\nGinger-beer\nPassage:\nAlpine skiing at the 1980 Winter Olympics – Men\'s downhill\nThe Men\'s Downhill competition of the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid was held at Whiteface Mountain on Thursday, February 14.\n\nThe defending world champion was Josef Walcher of Austria, while Switzerland\'s Peter Müller was the defending World Cup downhill champion and led the 1980 World Cup.\nDefending Olympic champion Franz Klammer did not compete; he was not selected to the Austrian Olympic team in 1980.\n\nGold medalist Leonhard Stock was an alternate on the Austrian downhill team, at the Olympics for the slalom. His fast training times earned him a spot on the four-man team, displacing Walcher, the reigning world champion. All four Austrians in the race finished in the top ten and Müller was fourth.\n\nResults\n\nSource:\nQuestion:\nWhat was the nationality of former Olympic downhill skier Franz Klammer?\nAnswer:\nAustrian\nPassage:\nHopman Cup\nThe Hopman Cup is an annual international eight-team indoor hardcourt tennis tournament held in Perth, Western Australia in early January (sometimes commencing in late December) each year, which plays mixed-gender teams on a country-by-country basis. \n\nThe championship is named in honour of Harry Hopman (1906–1985), an Australian tennis player and coach who guided the country to 15 Davis Cup titles between 1938 and 1969.  Since the Hopman Cup was founded in 1989, it has been attended each year by Harry Hopman\'s widow, his second wife Lucy, who travels to the tournament annually from her home in the United States. \n\nThe tournament is a sanctioned event in the calendar of the International Tennis Federation (ITF), but individual player results are not included in the calculation of the tennis world rankings. The competition receives extensive television coverage in Australia and is an important lead-up tournament to the Australian Open each January as part of the Australian Open Series. The winning team receives a silver cup perpetual trophy and up to 2014 the winning team members were presented with distinctive individual trophies in the shape of a tennis ball encrusted with diamonds from the Argyle diamond mine in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.  In 2014 and 2015, the individual trophies were created in the shape of an intricate diamond encrusted tennis racket and ball, using just under an ounce of 18-carat white, yellow and rose gold and approximately half an ounce of pink argyle diamonds. These trophies are valued at $26,000.\n\nUntil 2012, the Hopman Cup was played at the Burswood Dome. Since 2013, the Hopman Cup has been played at the Perth Arena. \n\nFormat\n\nUnlike other major international team tennis tournaments such as the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup, which are for men or women only, the Hopman Cup is a mixed competition in which male and female players are on combined teams and represent their countries. Players are invited to attend and national coaches are not involved in selecting teams.\n\nEight nations are selected annually to compete in the Hopman Cup. (The ""last"" team may be decided by play-offs between several nations before competition begins. For the 2007 Hopman Cup however, this did not occur, due to the Asian Qualifying Tournament creating the eighth team. The official tournament website also has no qualifier listed in its schedule.)\n\nEach team consists of one male player and one female player. Each match-up between two teams at the championships consists of:\n* one women\'s singles match\n* one men\'s singles match\n* one mixed doubles match\n\nThe eight competing teams are separated into two groups of four (with two teams being seeded) and face-off against each of the other three teams in their group in a round-robin format. These seedings ensure that each group has approximately similar strength. The top team in each group then meet in a final to decide the champions.\n\nIf a player is injured then a player of a lower ranking of that nation may be the substitute.\n\nManagement\n\nThe 2014 Hopman Cup Tournament Director is Paul Kilderry after the resignation of Steve Ayles.   Previously, the former Australian tennis player Paul McNamee, who played a key role in the founding of the championships, was the tournament director.\n\nHistory\n\nUp to and including 2012, the venue was the Burswood Dome at the Burswood Entertainment Complex.\n\nThe 2005/06 Hopman Cup was the first elite-level tennis tournament in which the system was introduced allowing players to challenge point-ending line calls similar to that in clay court tournaments. The challenged calls are immediately reviewed on a large monitor using Hawk-Eye technology.\n\nThe 20th Hopman Cup, in 2008, was intended to be the last held at the Burswood Dome, however this was extended until 2012 when the new Perth Arena was due for completion.\n\n2013 marks the 25th year of the running of the Hopman Cup.\n\nTelecasts\n\nThe Hopman Cup was originally broadcast by the Seven Network until 1994, then by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1995–2010). From 2011, a five-year deal to broadcast the Hopman Cup was signed by the commercial television station Network Ten a deal which ended abruptly in November 2013. 7mate subsequently picked up the telecasting rights. \n\nRecords and statistics\n\nPast champions\n\n  \n\nPast finalists\n\n* Consecutive titles\n** All-time: 2, United States, 2003–2004\n* Consecutive finals appearances\n** All-time: 4, United States, 2001–2004\n\nParticipation details\nQuestion:\nThe Hopman Cup is competed for in which sport?\nAnswer:\nLawn tennis\nPassage:\nGeorge Hammond (diplomat)\nGeorge Hammond (1763–1853) was a British diplomat and one of the first British envoys to the United States from 1791 to 1795.\n\nEarly career\n\nHammond came from East Riding of Yorkshire, enjoyed a liberal education, and was a Master of Arts and Fellow of Merton College, Oxford. During the peace talks between the 13 colonies of the United States of America and the Kingdom of Great Britain that would culminate in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, he served as a Secretary to David Hartley; while in Paris, he also learned some French. Subsequently, Hammond was appointed chargé d\'affaires at Vienna from 1788 to 1790, spent part of 1790 in Copenhagen, and in 1791 found himself Counsellor of Legation at Madrid.\n\nMinister to the United States\n\nDespite American grumbles over the lack of a British envoy since the peace treaty concluded the American revolution in 1783, the decision for the British was by no means a simple one. The Articles of Confederation lacked both a fixed seat of government and single leader to accredit an envoy, and few qualified diplomats desired the post and its yearly salary of £2500. David Hartley, himself approached for the position, recommended his former secretary Hammond to Charles Jenkinson, who in turn passed on the name to newly appointed Foreign Secretary William Grenville. Hammond was soon given the job, boarded a ship for Philadelphia in September 1791 along with Edward Thornton, secretary of legation, and arrived five weeks later on 20 October.\n\nHammond initially met with then Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, but waited to formally present himself to President George Washington before an American Minister to England was chosen; his reception on 11 November 1791 formally established relations between the two countries. Although Hammond described his situation as ""new, critical and rather embarrassing"", he also stated that ""If I accepted a quarter of the invitations to dinner and tea parties which I receive I should have little time for business"", and said of the leading families that ""I have reason to think most of them are Tories at heart.""\n\nHammond had four children, aged oldest to youngest: William Andrew, George, Margaret, Edmund. The titles (including spelling) and dates in the timeline come directly from these papers. They continue:\nIn the year 1806, when Mr. Hammond was entitled, from length of service, to a pension of 1,200 I., a pension of 600 l. was granted to him, together with pensions of 150 l. a year to each of his four children. His son, Edmund Hammond, would also join the Foreign Office.\n\nHammond left his post on 14 August 1795, leaving the consul general at Philadelphia, Phineas Bond, in charge until Robert Liston arrived in America.\n\nLater career\n\nFollowing his return from the United States, Hammond became an Undersecretary at the Foreign Office. In this position he advised and befriended Grenville and met George Canning; Canning founded the newspaper the Anti-Jacobin in 1797, and Hammond acted as joint-editor. Hammond would later be sent to one or two posts in continental Europe, and sometime in the 1810s he was appointed as a commissioner on the Arbitration of Revolutionary Indemnities, and as such spent many years living alternatively in London and Paris. Hammond died in 1853 at the age of ninety.\n\nTimeline of career\n\n*Secretary to Mr. Hartley\'s mission at Paris (1783 - 1784)\n*Charge d\'Affairs at Vienna (21 September 1788 - 10 October 1789)\n*Secretary of legation at Copenhagen (20 February 1790 - 23 September 1790)\n*Secretary of embassy at Madrid (24 September 1790 - 5 July 1791)\n*Minister plenipotentiary to the United States (5 July 1791 - 30 October 1795)\n*Under secretary of state for foreign affairs (10 October 1795 - 20 February 1806)\n*Under secretary of state for foreign affairs (5 April 1807 - 11 November 1809)\n*Commissioner for British claims on France (September 1814 - July 1828)\nQuestion:\nIn 1791 George Hammond was appointed the first British envoy to which country?\nAnswer:\nThe United States of America\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nFeature Album - Back To Bedlam by James Blunt | Jesse ...\nFeature Album - Back To Bedlam by James Blunt | Jesse Mulligan, 1–4pm,  2:50 pm on 11 November 2008 | Radio New Zealand\nFeature Album - Back To Bedlam by James Blunt\nFrom Jesse Mulligan, 1–4pm , 2:50 pm on 11 November 2008\nShare this\nTo embed this content on your own webpage, cut and paste the following:\n<iframe src=""http://www.radionz.co.nz/audio/remote-player?id=1780445"" width=""100%"" frameborder=""0"" height=""62px""></iframe>\nQuestion:\n‘Back to Bedlam’ was the debut album for which British singer?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 3098, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 3098, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 6}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

It is awarded based on votes from international media representatives and national team coaches and captains, who select the player they deem to have performed the best in the previous calendar year. A fusion between the former Ballon d\'Or and the men\'s FIFA World Player of the Year award, the FIFA Ballon d\'Or is considered the most prestigious individual award in world football. \n\nSince its inception, the FIFA Ballon d\'Or has been dominated by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of their ongoing rivalry. Barcelona\'s Messi won the inaugural Ballon d\'Or, before reclaiming the title the following two years and again in 2015. Ronaldo, who plays for Real Madrid, won two successive awards in the intervening years.\n\nBackground\n\nPrior to 2010, the leading individual awards in association football were the Ballon d\'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award.   The original Ballon d\'Or, also known as the European Footballer of the Year award, had been awarded by the French publication France Football since 1956. European sports journalists invited by France Football selected the recipients from among European or Europe-based players. The FIFA World Player of the Year award, presented by the governing body FIFA from 1991, was international in scope. Winners were chosen by the national team coaches and captains under FIFA\'s jurisdiction. \n  \nFrom 2005, the winners of the Ballon d\'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award were identical each year. Following the introduction of a global Ballon d\'Or format in 2007, France Football and FIFA opted to merge the two awards. The creation of the FIFA Ballon d\'Or was subsequently announced during the FIFA World Cup held in South Africa in 2010. The inaugural award was presented that same year to the Argentine Lionel Messi.  For historical purposes, both organisations regard the FIFA Ballon d\'Or as a continuation of their respective former awards.   The FIFA World Player of the Year award continues as a women\'s-only award. \n\nThe winner of the FIFA Ballon d\'Or is chosen by international media representatives and national team coaches and captains. In a voting system based on positional voting, each voter is allotted three votes, worth five points, three points and one point, and the three finalists are ordered based on total number of points. Voters are provided with a shortlist from which they can select the three players they deem to have performed the best in the previous calendar year.\n\nWinners\n\nWins by player\n\nWins by country\n\nWins by club\nQuestion:\nWho was awarded FIFA\'s Ballon D\'Or in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012?\nAnswer:\nLeo Messy\nPassage:\nCAMELOT (The Musical): ""How to Handle a Woman"" - YouTube\nCAMELOT (The Musical): ""How to Handle a Woman"" - YouTube\nCAMELOT (The Musical): ""How to Handle a Woman""\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

The cheese is especially known for its pungent odor caused by the bacteria Brevibacterium linens, which smells like strong body odor and particularly smelly feet. \n\nManufacture\n\nWhile today most Limburger is produced in Germany, Herve cheese is a type of Limburger which is still produced in the territory of the old Duchy of Limburg. Herve is located near Liège, and the borders separating Belgium from the Netherlands and Germany. The ""Pays de Herve"" is a hilly area between the Vesdre and Meuse rivers.\n\nIn the US, it was first produced in 1867 by Rudolph Benkerts in his cellar from pasteurized goat\'s milk.  A few years later, 25 factories produced this cheese. The Chalet Cheese Cooperative in Monroe, Wisconsin is the only American company that makes this cheese. It is also manufactured in Canada, where it is a German-Canadian cultural marker, by the Oak Grove Cheese Company in New Hamburg, Ontario.\n\nDescription\n\nIn its first month, the cheese is firmer and more crumbly, similar to the texture of feta cheese. After about six weeks, the cheese becomes softer along the edges but is still firm on the inside and can be described as salty and chalky. After two months of its life, it is mostly creamy and much smoother. Once it reaches three months, the cheese produces its notorious smell because of the bacterium used to ferment Limburger cheese and many other smear-ripened cheeses.   This is Brevibacterium linens, the same one found on human skin that is partially responsible for body odor and particularly foot odor.\n\nUses\n\nOne of the most traditional forms of eating limburger is the limburger sandwich. After three months, when the cheese has ripened, it becomes spreadable. The cheese is often spread thick (> 0.5\xa0cm) on firm-textured 100% rye bread, with a large, thick slice of onion, and is typically served with strong black coffee or lager beer. Alternatively, for heartier eaters, chunks or slices of the cheese up to 1.5\xa0cm thick can be cut off the block and placed in the sandwich. This sandwich still remains very popular among the descendants of German immigrants residing in the midwest part of America, such as in Cincinnati, or German Village in Columbus, Ohio. However, it is markedly less popular among the descendants born after ca. 1960, mainly because of the permeating smell, and the inconvenience of going to specialty cheese and sausage shops to obtain it. In Wisconsin, the Limburger sandwich can be found on menus at certain restaurants, accompanied by brown mustard. \n\nLimburger and its characteristic odor are a frequent butt of jokes and gags. Reactions to, and misinterpretations of, the smell of limburger cheese were gags used in numerous Little Rascals and Three Stooges comedy shorts.  Also, the arch-enemy of the Biker Mice from Mars has the name Lawrence Limburger, complete with terrible body odor.\n\nIn 2006, a study showing that the malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) is attracted equally to the smell of Limburger and to the smell of human feet earned the Ig Nobel Prize in the area of biology.   The results of the study were published in the medical journal The Lancet on 9 November 1996.\n\nNutrition facts\n\n28 grams of Limburger contains 5 grams of saturated fat and 8 grams of total fat. 67 of the 92 calories in the 28 grams are from fat.\nQuestion:\nFrom which country does \'Limburger\' cheese come?\nAnswer:\nBelguim\nPassage:\nRaymond Francis\nRaymond Francis (6 October 1911 – 24 October 1987) was an English actor best known for his role as Detective Chief Superintendent Tom Lockhart in the Associated-Rediffusion detective series Murder Bag, Crime Sheet and No Hiding Place.

Following a successful launch as a Business Expansion Scheme, it became a public limited company (plc) in 1992. Paul Theakston had been managing director of Theakstons brewery, also in Masham, since 1968. He began at the age of 23, taking over from his father, Frank Theakston.\n\nTheakstons brewery was bought by Matthew Brown following disagreements between members of the family and other shareholders, and in 1987 Matthew Brown was in turn taken over by Scottish and Newcastle. Paul Theakston left in 1988, and after a hiatus of more than a year purchased the North Yorkshire Malt Roasting Company, originally part of the former Lightfoot\'s brewery site, from an animal feed company, in order to start a new brewery in Masham.\n\nTheakston wanted to use the Lightfoot name to bring back an old brewing tradition; however it was discovered that this name had already been trademarked by Scottish and Newcastle. The associations of Masham with sheep led Theakston to come up with the name ""Sheep Brewery"" which rapidly became ""Black Sheep"" at his wife\'s suggestion.The first and original Black Sheep Best Bitter was sold at the Bruce Arms by its Landlord, David Young.\n\nThe brewery produces a range of well-hopped bitters, to distinguish itself from Theakston\'s range of fruity and yeasty beers. The brewery quickly became successful after formation, and now produces over 75,000 barrels a year. The brewery has capitalised on its popularity by converting unused parts of the original maltings into a visitors centre to promote visits to the brewery itself.\n\nThe brewery re-launched their Emmerdale Ale as a lower-alcohol beer (formerly 5%) on 27 January 2006 at The Crown in Manfield for the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA). The launch party saw Chris Chittell (Eric Pollard from the Emmerdale TV series) pull the first pint of the new brew. Emmerdale Ale is no longer brewed. The night also marked the rebranding of Black Sheep\'s Special Ale (in cask form) as Black Sheep Ale, the name that it has been sold as in bottles since 1992, bringing both into line. \n\nIn 2008, the brewery launched Draught Golden Sheep, a blonde cask beer with a refreshing citrus-hop flavour. It remains a seasonal brew. This, like all Black Sheep beers and indeed the brewing plant itself was created by Paul Ambler, Head Brewer since 1992 and later Operations Director. Paul Ambler has now retired. Comments Paul Theakston, ""Over the years, Paul Ambler has been a fierce champion of the quality of our beer, which is the keystone of our success"".\n\nAll bottled beers brewed by the Black Sheep Brewery are suitable for both vegetarians and vegans. \n\nCask beers\n\n* Black Sheep Ale (formerly Special Ale), 4.4%\n* Best Bitter, 3.8%.

This dialect word comes from the old Viking words: ‘rigg’(rygg) meaning back and ‘velte’ to overturn (the words and their meaning are still largely the same in the modern North Germanic languages).

The National Trust for Scotland owns the cave as part of a National Nature Reserve.  It became known as Fingal\'s Cave after the eponymous hero of an epic poem by 18th-century Scots poet-historian James Macpherson.\n\nFormation \n\nFingal\'s Cave is formed entirely from hexagonally jointed basalt columns within a Paleocene lava flow,  similar in structure to the Giant\'s Causeway in Northern Ireland and those of nearby Ulva.\n\nIn all these cases, cooling on the upper and lower surfaces of the solidified lava resulted in contraction and fracturing, starting in a blocky tetragonal pattern and transitioning to a regular hexagonal fracture pattern with fractures perpendicular to the cooling surfaces.  As cooling continued these cracks gradually extended toward the centre of the flow, forming the long hexagonal columns we see in the wave-eroded cross-section today.  Similar hexagonal fracture patterns are found in desiccation cracks in mud where contraction is due to loss of water instead of cooling. \n\nAcoustics \n\nThe cave\'s size and naturally arched roof,  and the eerie sounds produced by the echoes of waves, give it the atmosphere of a natural cathedral. The cave\'s Gaelic name, An Uaimh Bhinn, means ""the melodious cave.""\n\nHistory \n\nLittle is known of the early history of Staffa, although the Swiss town of Stäfa on Lake Zurich was named after the island by a monk from nearby Iona. Part of the Ulva estate of the Clan MacQuarrie from an early date until 1777,Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 124 the cave was brought to the attention of the English-speaking world by 18th-century naturalist Sir Joseph Banks in 1772.  \n\nIt became known as Fingal\'s Cave after the eponymous hero of an epic poem by 18th century Scots poet-historian James Macpherson. It formed part of his Ossian cycle of poems claimed to have been based on old Scottish Gaelic poems. In Irish mythology, the hero Fingal is known as Fionn mac Cumhaill, and it is suggested that Macpherson rendered the name as Fingal (meaning ""white stranger"" ) through a misapprehension of the name which in old Gaelic would appear as Finn.  The legend of the Giant\'s Causeway has Fionn or Finn building the causeway between Ireland and Scotland.[http://giantcrystals.strahlen.org/europe/basalt.htm Formation of basalt columns / pseudocrystals]\n\nSightseeing \n\nThe cave has a large arched entrance and is filled by the sea. Several sightseeing cruises organised from April to September by local companies pass the entrance to the cave. It is also possible to land elsewhere on the island (as some of these cruises permit) and walk overland to the cave, where a row of fractured columns forms a walkway just above high-water level permitting exploration on foot. From the inside, the entrance seems to frame the island of Iona across the water.\n\nIn art and literature \n\nRomantic composer Felix Mendelssohn visited in 1829 and wrote an overture, The Hebrides, Op. 26, (also known as Fingal\'s Cave overture), inspired by the weird echoes in the cave.  Mendelssohn\'s overture popularized the cave as a tourist destination. Other famous 19th-century visitors included author Jules Verne, who used it in his book Le Rayon vert (The Green Ray), and mentions it in the novels Journey to the Center of the Earth and The Mysterious Island; poets William Wordsworth, John Keats, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson; and Romantic artist J. M. W. Turner, who painted ""Staffa, Fingal\'s Cave"" in 1832.  Queen Victoria also made the trip.\n\nThe playwright August Strindberg also set scenes from his play A Dream Play in a place called ""Fingal\'s Grotto"". Scots novelist Sir Walter Scott described Fingal\'s Cave as ""one of the most extraordinary places I ever beheld. It exceeded, in my mind, every description I had heard of it... composed entirely of basaltic pillars as high as the roof of a cathedral, and running deep into the rock, eternally swept by a deep and swelling sea, and paved, as it were, with ruddy marble, [it] baffles all description."" \n\nArtist Matthew Barney used the cave along with the Giant\'s Causeway for the opening and closing scenes of his art film, Cremaster 3. In 2008, the video artist Richard Ashrowan spent several days recording the interior of Fingal\'s Cave for an exhibition at the Foksal Gallery in Poland.\n\nOne of Pink Floyd\'s early songs bears this location\'s name. This instrumental was written for the film Zabriskie Point but not used. \n\nLloyd House at Caltech has a mural representing Fingal\'s Cave.  The hallway that features this mural also houses a wooden statue named Fingal, which is among the oldest heirlooms at the institute.\n\nScottish Celtic rock band Wolfstone recorded an instrumental titled ""Fingal\'s Cave"" on their 1999 album Seven.\n\nDimensions \n\n* Wood-Nuttall Encyclopaedia, 1907: 69\xa0m (227\xa0ft) deep, 20\xa0m (66\xa0ft) high. \n* National Public Radio: 45\xa0m (150\xa0ft) deep; 22\xa0m (72\xa0ft) high. \n* Show Caves of the World: 85\xa0m (279\xa0ft) deep; 23\xa0m (75\xa0ft) high.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nOn which Scottish island will you find Fingal’s Cave?\nAnswer:\nStaffa\nPassage:\nAll my yesterdays; an autobiography (Book, 1973) [WorldCat ...\nAll my yesterdays; an autobiography (Book, 1973) [WorldCat.org]\nThe E-mail message field is required.

The canzone is famous as a showcase for tenors. Raffaele Mirate\'s performance of the bravura aria at the opera\'s 1851 premiere was hailed as the highlight of the evening. Before the opera\'s first public performance (in Venice), the song was rehearsed under tight secrecy:  a necessary precaution, as """" proved to be incredibly catchy, and soon after the song\'s first public performance, every gondolier in Venice was singing it.\n\nAs the opera progresses, the reprise of the tune in the following scenes exemplifies a sense of confusion, as Rigoletto realizes that from the sound of the Duke\'s lively voice coming from within the tavern (offstage), the body in the sack over which he had grimly triumphed, was not that of the Duke after all: Rigoletto had paid Sparafucile, an assassin, to kill the Duke, but Sparafucile had deceived Rigoletto by indiscriminately killing Gilda, Rigoletto\'s beloved daughter, instead. The song is an irony, as no character in the opera presents traits associated with rationality; every character may be considered callous and \' (""inconstant"").\n\nThe music\n\nThe almost comical-sounding theme of """" is introduced immediately, and runs as illustrated (transposed from the original key of B major). The theme is repeated several times in the approximately two to three minutes it takes to perform the aria, but with the important—and obvious—omission of the last bar. This has the effect of driving the music forward as it creates the impression of being incomplete and unresolved, which it is, ending not on the tonic or dominant but on the submediant. Once the Duke has finished singing, however, the theme is once again repeated; but this time it includes the last, and conclusive, bar and finally resolving to the tonic. The song is strophic in form with an orchestral ritornello.\n\nLibretto\nQuestion:\n\'La donna e mobile\' is from which Verdi opera?\nAnswer:\nRigeletto\nPassage:\nAudi and Volvo - Latin origin of the car company names ...\nAudi and Volvo - Latin origin of the car company names - High Names\n03.20.13 Posted in Naming blog by christa\nLet’s get back to the car business. We know a lot of the car companies are named after their founders – the trend was spread worldwide from the earliest electric automobiles. These include Ford (after Henry Ford), Peugeot (after the Peugeot family), also later Bentley (after Walter Owen Bentley), Porsche (after Ferdinand Porsche). The trend is also present in Asia by car manufacturers like Toyota (after Kiichiro Toyoda) and Honda (after Soichiro Honda).\nHowever, there are still original company names between the world-wide known brands in the car industry. The naming strategy is often so unique that they cannot be put in categories. But Audi and Volvo can. Can you guess what the connection between those two famous car companies is in terms of naming? Latin.\nVolvo – on the different car company names\nDespite that Volvo is a Swedish company the founders didn’t name the car Viking or Nordic or anything like that. They decided on the Latin word volvere, meaning to roll. It seems a logical word choice since the purpose of working on a Swedish car project was to build cars that could withstand the cold Scandinavian weather and uneven roads – basically a car that rolls. What they did is only conjugate the verb volvere in first person (because unlike in English many other languages use similar but still different words when saying I roll, you roll, etc) and voilà – you have Volvo. It’s like the car speaks to you – I roll.\nAudi – on the translated car company names\nThe reason for naming the famous car company Audi\xa0isn’t that spontaneous compared to Volvo. The truth is that the founder August Horch (and no the AU in Audi doesn’t come from the first two letters of the founder’s name) had originally founded another car company named August Horch & Co. This happened in 1904 when the German engineer had quit working for Karl Benz. However, after some problems in the company, in 1909 Horch founded a second company – but his family name could not be used again as a name for the company because he didn’t have the rights on the company name. The story says that one of his business partners’ son came up with the name Audi. But this wasn’t a random Latin word that simply starts with the letter A (as you may know by now from our blog posts having a company name that starts with A is great because you get listed early in alphabetically ordered lists). If you speak German you’ll know that horch comes from the infinitive form of horchen and actually has a meaning – to listen (carefully). Now, can you guess what the Latin translation of horchen is? It’s audire – a verb that when conjugated in the same form as horch, becomes audi. The name seemed logical since August Horch could no longer use his own name. And a little more than 100 years later Audi is still one of the most popular names in the car industry.\nQuestion:\nWhat car maker\'s name means \'roll\' in Latin?\nAnswer:\nGlossary of Volvo features\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nNaismith Legacy Awards — Naismith.com\nNaismith Legacy Awards — Naismith.com\nGet in Touch\nWhat is the purpose of the Naismith Legacy Award?\nThe Naismith Legacy Award is presented to players, coaches and other individuals or organizations from the game of basketball honoring their role in furthering the values of Honor, Respect and Integrity, both on and off the court.

Dawson was often present at finds in the archaeological digs, or was the finder himself.\n\nBorn the eldest of three sons, Dawson moved with his family to Hastings, Sussex, when he was still very young. Charles initially studied as a lawyer following his father and pursued a hobby of collecting and studying fossils. He made a number of seemingly important fossil finds. Amongst these were teeth from a previously unknown species of mammal, later named Plagiaulax dawsoni in his honour; three new species of dinosaur, one later named Iguanodon dawsoni; and a new form of fossil plant, Salaginella dawsoni. The British Museum conferred upon him the title of Honorary Collector. For these important finds he was elected a fellow of the Geological Society and a few years later after another find, to the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1895. Dawson died prematurely from septicaemia in 1916.\n\nAlleged discoveries\n\nIn 1889 Dawson was a co-founder of the Hastings and St Leonards Museum Association, one of the first voluntary museum friends groups established in Britain. Dawson worked on a voluntary basis as a member of the Museum Committee, in charge of the acquisition of artefacts and documents. His interest in archaeology developed and he had an uncanny knack of making spectacular discoveries, The Sussex Daily News named him the ""Wizard of Sussex"" for his success.\n\nIn 1893 Dawson investigated a curious flint mine full of prehistoric, Roman and mediaeval artefacts at Lavant, near Chichester and probed in inner depths of two tunnels beneath Hastings Castle. In the same year he presented the British Museum with a Roman statuette from Beauport Park which was made, uniquely for the period, of cast iron. Other discoveries followed, including a strange form of hafted Neolithic stone axe and a well-preserved ancient timber boat.\n\nHe studied ancient quarries, reanalysed the Bayeux Tapestry and in 1909 produced what was then the definitive study of Hastings Castle. He later found faked evidence for the final phases of Roman occupation in Britain at Pevensey Castle in Sussex.  Investigating unusual elements of the natural world, Dawson found a toad petrified inside a flint nodule, discovered a large supply of natural gas at Heathfield in East Sussex, reported on a sea-serpent in the English Channel, observed a new species of human and found a strange goldfish/carp hybrid. It was even reported that he was experimenting with phosphorescent bullets as a deterrent to Zeppelin attacks on London.\n\nIn recognition of his many discoveries, Dawson was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries London in 1895. At the age of 31, and without a university degree to his name, he was now Charles Dawson F.G.S., F.S.A. His most famous discovery was in 1912 with the discovery of the Piltdown Man which was billed as the ""missing link"" between humans and other great apes.\n\nCriticism\n\nQuestions about the Piltdown find were raised from the beginning, first by Arthur Keith, but also by paleontologists and anatomists from the Smithsonian Institution and from Europe. Those disputing the find were attacked in very personal terms. Challenges to Piltdown Man arose again in the 1920s, but were again dismissed. In 1949, further questions were raised about the Piltdown Man and its authenticity, which led to Piltdown being conclusively proven a hoax in 1953. Since then a number of Dawson\'s other finds have also been proven to be fakes or planted.  \n\nIn 2003, Dr. Miles Russell of Bournemouth University published the results of his investigation into Dawson\'s antiquarian collection and concluded that at least 38 specimens were clear fakes. Russell has noted that Dawson’s whole academic career appears to have been ""one built upon deceit, sleight of hand, fraud and deception, the ultimate gain being international recognition"".\n\nCharles Dawson never received a knighthood, though many others associated with the Piltdown ""find"" did, and was never elected to the Royal Society. Following his death in 1916, no further finds were made at Piltdown.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name given to the \'Missing Link\' which Charles Dawson claimed to have discovered in a gravel pit in Sussex in 1912?\nAnswer:\nPiltdown Man\nPassage:\nThe Confession of Isobel Gowdie\nThe Confession of Isobel Gowdie is a work for large symphony orchestra by the Scottish composer James MacMillan.\n\nIt is, according to the composer, a Requiem for one Isobel Gowdie, supposedly burnt as a witch in post-Reformation Scotland. Despite the work\'s depiction of the violent torture and execution of Gowdie, it is actually thought that no torture took place prior to her confession.\n\nIt was written in 1990 and premiered at that year\'s Proms concerts in London. It was an instant success, receiving, according to the critic Stephen Johnson, ""an ovation the like of which had rarely been seen at a British premiere since the death of Benjamin Britten"". \n\nThe work falls into three major sections: an opening, elegiac string section, followed by a violent middle part (according to Johnson, redolent of ""trial, torture or mass hysteria"") followed by a return to the more subdued atmosphere of the opening for strings, but this time punctuated by violent outbursts from the full orchestra. It resolves on one note, in a massive crescendo to fffff which bears the hallmark of a similar motif in Alban Berg\'s Wozzeck.\n\nThe work was premiered by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, under Jerzy Maksymiuk, who later recorded it. It has been performed and recorded many times since, including repeat performances by the BBC SSO, and the RSAMD Symphony Orchestra in the composer\'s 50th birthday celebrations.\n\nInstrumentation \n\nThe Confession of Isobel Gowdie is scored for the following orchestra: \n\n8 Woodwinds\n* 2 Flutes (2nd doubling Piccolo)\n* 2 Oboes (2nd doubling Cor Anglais)\n* 2 Clarinets in B♭ (2nd doubling Bass Clarinet)\n* 2 Bassoons (2nd doubling Contrabassoon)\n11 Brass\n* 4 Horns in F\n* 3 Trumpets in C\n* 2 Trombones\n* Bass Trombone\n* Tuba\nTimpani\n\n2 Percussion\n# 2 Congas (high, low), 2 Timbales (high, low), Xylophone, 3 Tam-tams (small, medium, large), Anvil, Tubular bells\n# Snare drum, 2 Congas (high, low), Vibraphone, Bass drum, very large tam-tam\n* (The 2  players are to be as far apart as possible to enhance the antiphonal effects.)\nStrings\nQuestion:\nName the contemporary Scottish composer whose works include The Confession of Isobel Gowdie and Vent, Veni Emmanuel written for the percussionist Evelyn Glennie?\nAnswer:\nJames MacMillan (musician)\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nLondon 2012 Summer Olympics - results & video highlights\nLondon 2012 Summer Olympics - results & video highlights\nOfficial Reports arrow\nThe London 2012 Games were centred around the Olympic Park in east London, which is the site of a number of new sports venues. Up to 180,000 spectators a day entered the Park to enjoy the Games, making it the principal focus of Olympic activity.\nThe main venues – the Olympic Stadium, Aquatics Centre, Velodrome and BMX Circuit, as well as the hockey, handball and basketball arenas – were easily accessible through a network of footbridges and walkways within the Park.\nThe Olympic Village was within walking distance of all the venues in the Park, enhancing the experience for athletes and officials. The use of other prestigious venues – such as Wembley Stadium for football, the All-England Club in Wimbledon for tennis, Lord’s Cricket Ground for archery and Horse Guards Parade for beach volleyball – was also a feature of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\nThe London 2012 Games included a four-year Cultural Olympiad. It reached a climax with the Olympic Games Opening Ceremony on 27 July 2012, starting a 60-day festival of sport and culture across the UK, as the Olympic and Paralympic spirit crosses the world once again.\nLondon 2012 by numbers\nThe Olympic Games are one of the biggest and most complex events in the world, as highlighted by some of these mind-boggling facts and figures:\n26 sports, featuring 39 disciplines, were contested during the Games across 34 venues\nThe Olympic Park, which held nine venues, was 2.5sq km in size – equivalent to 357 football pitches\n8.8 million tickets were available for the London 2012 Olympic Games\nAbout 10,500 athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees took part in the Games, with 302 medal events being held\nOver 21,000 accredited media communicated the Games to a potential worldwide audience of 4 billion people\nThere were also 2,961 technical officials and 5,770 team officials\nA total workforce of around 200,000 people, including more than 6,000 staffs, 70,000 volunteers and 100,000 contractors, were involved in the Games\nLOCOG had sourced over one million pieces of sport equipment for the Games, including 510 adjustable hurdles for athletics, 600 basket balls, 2,700 foot balls and 356 pairs of boxing gloves\nDuring the Games, 20 million spectator journeys were made in London, including three million on the busiest day of the Games\nApproximately 14 million meals were served at the Games, including 45,000 per day in the Olympic Village\nOn the obverse, the traditional goddess of victory flies into the Panathinaikos stadium bringing victory to the best athlete. For these Games, the figure of victory is accompanied by the specific inscription: “ XXX Olympiad London 2012 ”.\nThe reverse features an abstract design with the 2012 Games emblem at its centre as a metaphor for the modern city. The design also includes a ribbon representing London’s Thames river and an interlocking grid pattern that radiates from the centre and pulls the design together, giving it a sense of outreach while also representing the achievements and efforts of Olympic athletes. A square, which encases the balance of the design, opposes the circular shape of the medals and emphasizes its focus on the centre, reinforcing the sense of ‘place, as in a map inset.\nMore info\nWenlock\nWenlock takes his name from the town of Much Wenlock in Shropshire, which still hosts the traditional Much Wenlock Games.

If it is labelled ""Crème de Cassis de Dijon,"" one is guaranteed berries from the commune of Dijon.\n\nIn 2015, the new protected geographical indication (PGI) “Crème de Cassis de Bourgogne” has been approved. Promoted by a syndicate of fruit producers and liqueurs companies from Burgundy. This ""Crème de Cassis de Bourgogne"" guarantees the burgundian origin and the minimum quantity of berries used in its production, essentially the variety Noir de Bourgogne.\n\nSales\n\nNearly 16\xa0million litres of crème de cassis are produced annually in France.  It is consumed mostly in France but is also exported.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nIt is a favourite drink of the fictional detective Hercule Poirot.\nQuestion:\nWith which fruit is the liqueur \'Creme de Cassis\' made?\nAnswer:\nGrossularia nigra\nPassage:\nJonathan, son of King Saul, friend of David, Bible bios ...\nJonathan, son of King Saul, friend of David, Bible bios, Bible Stories\nwould know that everything was okay and he could come back to  the king\'s house.\xa0\n\xa0If Jonathon told the lad that the arrows are beyond him,  then\nshould run away to preserve his own life.\nSure enough, King Saul became angry at Jonathan during dinner because\nwasn\'t also at the table.\xa0 King Saul yelled to\nto go get\nso  that King Saul could kill him.\nWhen\n\xa0tried to ask his father what wrong thing that\nhad done,  King Saul threw a javelin at his own son.\n\xa0\nSo\n\xa0went out to the field with his bow and arrows and a young lad.\xa0 He shot an arrow and told the young lad that that arrow had gone beyond him.\xa0 The young lad gathered all the arrows and then\n\xa0\ntold the lad to go back to  the city.\nThen\ncame out of his hiding place and\n\xa0cried together and said good-bye to each  other and promised to always be  friends.\n\xa0\n6.\xa0 David was the son of\n\xa0\n\xa0\nOne time            when the armies of Saul were fighting            the Philistines, King Saul made all his            soldiers take an oath not to eat until            evening.\xa0 Jonathan was away from            King Saul and didn\'t hear what he said            about the oath.\xa0\nAlthough            Jonathan and his armor bearer killed 20            Philistines by themselves, King Saul            wanted to kill Jonathan because Jonathan            ate some honey that day.\nKing            Saul\'s soldiers realized how wrong Saul            was and they rescued Jonathan from the            king so he wouldn\'t be killed.\nJonathan            fought a lot of successful battles            against the Philistines; but he was            eventually killed by a Philistine on the            same day that his father, King Saul and            two of his brothers were killed.\nQuestion:\nIn the Bible, what was the name of the son of Saul who became a great friend of David?\nAnswer:\nJonathon\nPassage:\nLeonard Bernstein, Shostakovich, Symphony no. 5, Allegro ...\nLeonard Bernstein, Shostakovich, Symphony no. 5, Allegro non troppo (1979) - YouTube\nLeonard Bernstein, Shostakovich, Symphony no. 5, Allegro non troppo (1979)\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

It consists of six equal horizontal bands of black (top), yellow, red, black, yellow, and red (bottom); a white disc is superimposed at the centre and depicts the national symbol, a grey crowned crane, facing the hoist side. \n\nDuring the colonial era the British used a British Blue ensign defaced with the colonial badge, as prescribed in 1865 regulations. Buganda, the largest of the traditional kingdoms in the colony of Uganda, had its own flag.   However, in order to avoid appearing to give preference to one region of the colony over any other, the British colonial authorities selected the crane emblem for use on the Blue ensign and other official banners.  \n\nHistory\n\nWhen the Democratic Party ruled the country, a design for flag was proposed. It had vertical stripes of green-blue-green, separated by narrower yellow stripes, and in the centre had the silhouette of a yellow crane. After the party lost the national elections on April 25, 1962 the newly elected Uganda People’s Congress (UPC) rejected the former design and instead proposed the current design. It was based on the flag of UPC– a tricolor having horizontal strips of red, yellow and black. The British administration gave their approval to this design before the country\'s independence. The flag was designed by the Ugandan Minister of Justice, Grace Ibingira.\n\nSymbolism\n\nThe three colours are representative of African peoples (black), Africa\'s sunshine (yellow), and African brotherhood (red being the colour of blood, through which all Africans are connected).   The grey crowned crane is fabled for its gentle nature and was also the military badge of Ugandan soldiers during British rule. The raised leg of the crane symbolizes the forward movement of the country.  \n\nOther flags\n\nFile:Flag of the Uganda Protectorate.svg|Flag of the Uganda Protectorate (1914-March, 1962)\nFile:Standard of the Governor of the Uganda Protectorate.svg|Standard of the Governor of Uganda (1914 - March, 1962)\nFile:Flag of Uganda 1962.svg|National flag (March - October 9, 1962) \nFile:Presidential Standard of Uganda.svg|Presidential Standard of Uganda\n\nSimilar Flags\nQuestion:\nWhat kind of bird appears on the flag of Uganda?\nAnswer:\nCrowned crane (disambiguation)\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nDonald\'s Nephews\nDonald\'s Nephews (1938) is a Donald Duck animated cartoon which features Donald being visited by his three nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. This cartoon is Huey, Dewey, and Louie\'s very first appearance in animation.   The short, and the three nephews, was the idea of Al Taliaferro, the artist for the Silly Symphonies comic strip, which featured Donald Duck. The Walt Disney Productions Story Dept. on February 5, 1937, sent Taliaferro a memo recognizing him as the source of the idea for the planned short.  Taliaferro subsequently introduced the nephews in his comic strip, which by this time had been renamed Donald Duck, on Sunday, October 17, 1937, beating the theatrical release of Donald\'s Nephews by almost six months. \n\nPlot\n\nDonald receives a postcard from his sister, Dumbella, which says that her three boys, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, are coming to visit him. At first Donald is excited to see his nephews, but soon the boys start causing problems, being a constant annoyance to their uncle.\n\nDonald consults a book entitled Modern Child Training, and tries to use the suggestions to gain control over his nephews, but things only get worse. In the end, after the boys leave and with his house left almost destroyed, Donald spots a page which reads ""After all, little children are only angels without wings"". This so enrages Donald that he rips the book to pieces and explodes.\n\nNephews Antics\n\nThroughout the cartoon, Huey, Dewey, and Louie play tricks on their Uncle Donald in order to annoy him. They cause extensive damage throughout his house, and have fun at Donald\'s expense. Some of their activities include:\n* Playing croquet on tricycles in Donald\'s living room, breaking vases, lamps, and windows\n* As Donald plays the piano to try to calm his nephews, the boys pick up instruments to play along with him, however Dewey uses his trombone to launch an apple at Donald, and Huey uses his cello to project his bow at Donald\n* While Donald plays the piano, Huey fills a bag with water, and Louie bursts it with his slingshot\n* Giving Donald a pie full of scorching hot mustard, then, to cool him down, they throw water on him and spray him in the face with a fire extinguisher, then throw his book at him and ride away on their tricycles\n\nAvailability\n\n* Walt Disney\'s Funny Factory With Huey Dewey & Louie Vol. 4\nQuestion:\nWhat are the names of Donald Duck\'s three nephews?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 3135, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 3135, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 6}]",1,0.8333333333333334,20275,20275.0,336.76,4,4.0,0.07,6,0.02,1,18.247429498999736,ml.g5.48xlarge,llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235,meta-textgeneration-llama-2-70b-2024-01-20-17-53-55-754,763104351884.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference:2.0.1-tgi1.1.0-gpu-py39-cu118-ubuntu20.04,s3://jumpstart-private-cache-prod-us-east-1/meta-textgeneration/meta-textgeneration-llama-2-70b/artifacts/inference-prepack/v1.0.0/,3600,/opt/ml/model,4095,4096,/opt/ml/model,1,1,inference.py,8,,,,

The National Trust for Scotland owns the cave as part of a National Nature Reserve.  It became known as Fingal\'s Cave after the eponymous hero of an epic poem by 18th-century Scots poet-historian James Macpherson.\n\nFormation \n\nFingal\'s Cave is formed entirely from hexagonally jointed basalt columns within a Paleocene lava flow,  similar in structure to the Giant\'s Causeway in Northern Ireland and those of nearby Ulva.\n\nIn all these cases, cooling on the upper and lower surfaces of the solidified lava resulted in contraction and fracturing, starting in a blocky tetragonal pattern and transitioning to a regular hexagonal fracture pattern with fractures perpendicular to the cooling surfaces.  As cooling continued these cracks gradually extended toward the centre of the flow, forming the long hexagonal columns we see in the wave-eroded cross-section today.  Similar hexagonal fracture patterns are found in desiccation cracks in mud where contraction is due to loss of water instead of cooling. \n\nAcoustics \n\nThe cave\'s size and naturally arched roof,  and the eerie sounds produced by the echoes of waves, give it the atmosphere of a natural cathedral. The cave\'s Gaelic name, An Uaimh Bhinn, means ""the melodious cave.""\n\nHistory \n\nLittle is known of the early history of Staffa, although the Swiss town of Stäfa on Lake Zurich was named after the island by a monk from nearby Iona. Part of the Ulva estate of the Clan MacQuarrie from an early date until 1777,Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 124 the cave was brought to the attention of the English-speaking world by 18th-century naturalist Sir Joseph Banks in 1772.  \n\nIt became known as Fingal\'s Cave after the eponymous hero of an epic poem by 18th century Scots poet-historian James Macpherson. It formed part of his Ossian cycle of poems claimed to have been based on old Scottish Gaelic poems. In Irish mythology, the hero Fingal is known as Fionn mac Cumhaill, and it is suggested that Macpherson rendered the name as Fingal (meaning ""white stranger"" ) through a misapprehension of the name which in old Gaelic would appear as Finn.  The legend of the Giant\'s Causeway has Fionn or Finn building the causeway between Ireland and Scotland.[http://giantcrystals.strahlen.org/europe/basalt.htm Formation of basalt columns / pseudocrystals]\n\nSightseeing \n\nThe cave has a large arched entrance and is filled by the sea. Several sightseeing cruises organised from April to September by local companies pass the entrance to the cave. It is also possible to land elsewhere on the island (as some of these cruises permit) and walk overland to the cave, where a row of fractured columns forms a walkway just above high-water level permitting exploration on foot. From the inside, the entrance seems to frame the island of Iona across the water.\n\nIn art and literature \n\nRomantic composer Felix Mendelssohn visited in 1829 and wrote an overture, The Hebrides, Op. 26, (also known as Fingal\'s Cave overture), inspired by the weird echoes in the cave.  Mendelssohn\'s overture popularized the cave as a tourist destination. Other famous 19th-century visitors included author Jules Verne, who used it in his book Le Rayon vert (The Green Ray), and mentions it in the novels Journey to the Center of the Earth and The Mysterious Island; poets William Wordsworth, John Keats, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson; and Romantic artist J. M. W. Turner, who painted ""Staffa, Fingal\'s Cave"" in 1832.  Queen Victoria also made the trip.\n\nThe playwright August Strindberg also set scenes from his play A Dream Play in a place called ""Fingal\'s Grotto"". Scots novelist Sir Walter Scott described Fingal\'s Cave as ""one of the most extraordinary places I ever beheld. It exceeded, in my mind, every description I had heard of it... composed entirely of basaltic pillars as high as the roof of a cathedral, and running deep into the rock, eternally swept by a deep and swelling sea, and paved, as it were, with ruddy marble, [it] baffles all description."" \n\nArtist Matthew Barney used the cave along with the Giant\'s Causeway for the opening and closing scenes of his art film, Cremaster 3. In 2008, the video artist Richard Ashrowan spent several days recording the interior of Fingal\'s Cave for an exhibition at the Foksal Gallery in Poland.\n\nOne of Pink Floyd\'s early songs bears this location\'s name. This instrumental was written for the film Zabriskie Point but not used. \n\nLloyd House at Caltech has a mural representing Fingal\'s Cave.  The hallway that features this mural also houses a wooden statue named Fingal, which is among the oldest heirlooms at the institute.\n\nScottish Celtic rock band Wolfstone recorded an instrumental titled ""Fingal\'s Cave"" on their 1999 album Seven.\n\nDimensions \n\n* Wood-Nuttall Encyclopaedia, 1907: 69\xa0m (227\xa0ft) deep, 20\xa0m (66\xa0ft) high. \n* National Public Radio: 45\xa0m (150\xa0ft) deep; 22\xa0m (72\xa0ft) high. \n* Show Caves of the World: 85\xa0m (279\xa0ft) deep; 23\xa0m (75\xa0ft) high.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nOn which Scottish island will you find Fingal’s Cave?\nAnswer:\nStaffa\nPassage:\nAll my yesterdays; an autobiography (Book, 1973) [WorldCat ...\nAll my yesterdays; an autobiography (Book, 1973) [WorldCat.org]\nThe E-mail message field is required.

The canzone is famous as a showcase for tenors. Raffaele Mirate\'s performance of the bravura aria at the opera\'s 1851 premiere was hailed as the highlight of the evening. Before the opera\'s first public performance (in Venice), the song was rehearsed under tight secrecy:  a necessary precaution, as """" proved to be incredibly catchy, and soon after the song\'s first public performance, every gondolier in Venice was singing it.\n\nAs the opera progresses, the reprise of the tune in the following scenes exemplifies a sense of confusion, as Rigoletto realizes that from the sound of the Duke\'s lively voice coming from within the tavern (offstage), the body in the sack over which he had grimly triumphed, was not that of the Duke after all: Rigoletto had paid Sparafucile, an assassin, to kill the Duke, but Sparafucile had deceived Rigoletto by indiscriminately killing Gilda, Rigoletto\'s beloved daughter, instead. The song is an irony, as no character in the opera presents traits associated with rationality; every character may be considered callous and \' (""inconstant"").\n\nThe music\n\nThe almost comical-sounding theme of """" is introduced immediately, and runs as illustrated (transposed from the original key of B major). The theme is repeated several times in the approximately two to three minutes it takes to perform the aria, but with the important—and obvious—omission of the last bar. This has the effect of driving the music forward as it creates the impression of being incomplete and unresolved, which it is, ending not on the tonic or dominant but on the submediant. Once the Duke has finished singing, however, the theme is once again repeated; but this time it includes the last, and conclusive, bar and finally resolving to the tonic. The song is strophic in form with an orchestral ritornello.\n\nLibretto\nQuestion:\n\'La donna e mobile\' is from which Verdi opera?\nAnswer:\nRigeletto\nPassage:\nAudi and Volvo - Latin origin of the car company names ...\nAudi and Volvo - Latin origin of the car company names - High Names\n03.20.13 Posted in Naming blog by christa\nLet’s get back to the car business. We know a lot of the car companies are named after their founders – the trend was spread worldwide from the earliest electric automobiles. These include Ford (after Henry Ford), Peugeot (after the Peugeot family), also later Bentley (after Walter Owen Bentley), Porsche (after Ferdinand Porsche). The trend is also present in Asia by car manufacturers like Toyota (after Kiichiro Toyoda) and Honda (after Soichiro Honda).\nHowever, there are still original company names between the world-wide known brands in the car industry. The naming strategy is often so unique that they cannot be put in categories. But Audi and Volvo can. Can you guess what the connection between those two famous car companies is in terms of naming? Latin.\nVolvo – on the different car company names\nDespite that Volvo is a Swedish company the founders didn’t name the car Viking or Nordic or anything like that. They decided on the Latin word volvere, meaning to roll. It seems a logical word choice since the purpose of working on a Swedish car project was to build cars that could withstand the cold Scandinavian weather and uneven roads – basically a car that rolls. What they did is only conjugate the verb volvere in first person (because unlike in English many other languages use similar but still different words when saying I roll, you roll, etc) and voilà – you have Volvo. It’s like the car speaks to you – I roll.\nAudi – on the translated car company names\nThe reason for naming the famous car company Audi\xa0isn’t that spontaneous compared to Volvo. The truth is that the founder August Horch (and no the AU in Audi doesn’t come from the first two letters of the founder’s name) had originally founded another car company named August Horch & Co. This happened in 1904 when the German engineer had quit working for Karl Benz. However, after some problems in the company, in 1909 Horch founded a second company – but his family name could not be used again as a name for the company because he didn’t have the rights on the company name. The story says that one of his business partners’ son came up with the name Audi. But this wasn’t a random Latin word that simply starts with the letter A (as you may know by now from our blog posts having a company name that starts with A is great because you get listed early in alphabetically ordered lists). If you speak German you’ll know that horch comes from the infinitive form of horchen and actually has a meaning – to listen (carefully). Now, can you guess what the Latin translation of horchen is? It’s audire – a verb that when conjugated in the same form as horch, becomes audi. The name seemed logical since August Horch could no longer use his own name. And a little more than 100 years later Audi is still one of the most popular names in the car industry.\nQuestion:\nWhat car maker\'s name means \'roll\' in Latin?\nAnswer:\nGlossary of Volvo features\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nNaismith Legacy Awards — Naismith.com\nNaismith Legacy Awards — Naismith.com\nGet in Touch\nWhat is the purpose of the Naismith Legacy Award?\nThe Naismith Legacy Award is presented to players, coaches and other individuals or organizations from the game of basketball honoring their role in furthering the values of Honor, Respect and Integrity, both on and off the court. The recipients are honored by the NLG at special ceremonies at select Tour locations.\nHow are the Naismith Legacy Award recipients determined?\nUnique among sports honors, most of which are granted annually after a competitive process, the NL Award is given on an ad-hoc basis, meaning not in regular or schedules timeframes. Recipients are nominated by a distinguished NL Nominating Committee, and then selected by the NL Board of Directors and Selection Committee for their role in furthering the values of fun, respect, integrity, honor and teamwork that Dr. Naismith wrote into the “Original Rules.”\nWhat are the details of the Naismith Legacy Award?\nThe NL Award which stands about 2 ½ feet tall and weighs about 80 pounds features a specially commissioned 3 dimensional sculpture by Michael Roche of Dr. Naismith standing in the YMCA gym during the 1890’s. The work is based on photographs of Dr. Naismith and the YMCA gymnasium where he invented the basketball the winter of 1891. Renowned artist / sculptor Michael Roche, who specializes in highly detailed collectibles, created the sculpture, which bears the inscription: “In Recognition of the Invention of Basketball and a Life Lived with Honor” and a copy of the 13 rules he placed on the bulletin board etched on the back of award. Roche’s work includes some of the most prestigious clients, sports figures and unique artwork for any awards including, “gunslingers” golfers” and movie characters like Wizard of Oz and sports figures like, Old Tom Morris, Newt Rockne and legendary athlete Jim Thorpe.\nWhen presenting the award, we require being included in a current event within the recipient’s organization or town, or a special event built around the presentation itself. The award is financed by the local businesses and organizations who partner in promoting the recipient.\nThe “Mid-Size” Naismith Legacy Award stands about 14” high, weighs about 10 pounds and is used to honor top volunteers, coaches, officials, donors or sponsors of your organization. Most awards are funded by the organization or a local sponsor who wants to be affiliated with such a prestigious award. We have the award qualification form and nomination form for you to use in the selection process. For example, we have had great success in using this as a “Coach of the Year” award in local high schools and as a year-end award for the coaches in the whole county presented at the year-end banquet. It also works well as a “Volunteer / Sponsor / Donor Appreciation” award.\nWhat is the Doc Naismith Award?\nThe Doc Naismith Award recipients exemplify the core values the Dr. Naismith lived by and we honor like: respect, teamwork, sportsmanship, honesty, servant hood, integrity and excellence.

If it is labelled ""Crème de Cassis de Dijon,"" one is guaranteed berries from the commune of Dijon.\n\nIn 2015, the new protected geographical indication (PGI) “Crème de Cassis de Bourgogne” has been approved.

It consists of six equal horizontal bands of black (top), yellow, red, black, yellow, and red (bottom); a white disc is superimposed at the centre and depicts the national symbol, a grey crowned crane, facing the hoist side. \n\nDuring the colonial era the British used a British Blue ensign defaced with the colonial badge, as prescribed in 1865 regulations. Buganda, the largest of the traditional kingdoms in the colony of Uganda, had its own flag.   However, in order to avoid appearing to give preference to one region of the colony over any other, the British colonial authorities selected the crane emblem for use on the Blue ensign and other official banners.  \n\nHistory\n\nWhen the Democratic Party ruled the country, a design for flag was proposed. It had vertical stripes of green-blue-green, separated by narrower yellow stripes, and in the centre had the silhouette of a yellow crane. After the party lost the national elections on April 25, 1962 the newly elected Uganda People’s Congress (UPC) rejected the former design and instead proposed the current design. It was based on the flag of UPC– a tricolor having horizontal strips of red, yellow and black. The British administration gave their approval to this design before the country\'s independence. The flag was designed by the Ugandan Minister of Justice, Grace Ibingira.\n\nSymbolism\n\nThe three colours are representative of African peoples (black), Africa\'s sunshine (yellow), and African brotherhood (red being the colour of blood, through which all Africans are connected).   The grey crowned crane is fabled for its gentle nature and was also the military badge of Ugandan soldiers during British rule. The raised leg of the crane symbolizes the forward movement of the country.  \n\nOther flags\n\nFile:Flag of the Uganda Protectorate.svg|Flag of the Uganda Protectorate (1914-March, 1962)\nFile:Standard of the Governor of the Uganda Protectorate.svg|Standard of the Governor of Uganda (1914 - March, 1962)\nFile:Flag of Uganda 1962.svg|National flag (March - October 9, 1962) \nFile:Presidential Standard of Uganda.svg|Presidential Standard of Uganda\n\nSimilar Flags\nQuestion:\nWhat kind of bird appears on the flag of Uganda?\nAnswer:\nCrowned crane (disambiguation)\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nDonald\'s Nephews\nDonald\'s Nephews (1938) is a Donald Duck animated cartoon which features Donald being visited by his three nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. This cartoon is Huey, Dewey, and Louie\'s very first appearance in animation.   The short, and the three nephews, was the idea of Al Taliaferro, the artist for the Silly Symphonies comic strip, which featured Donald Duck. The Walt Disney Productions Story Dept. on February 5, 1937, sent Taliaferro a memo recognizing him as the source of the idea for the planned short.  Taliaferro subsequently introduced the nephews in his comic strip, which by this time had been renamed Donald Duck, on Sunday, October 17, 1937, beating the theatrical release of Donald\'s Nephews by almost six months. \n\nPlot\n\nDonald receives a postcard from his sister, Dumbella, which says that her three boys, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, are coming to visit him. At first Donald is excited to see his nephews, but soon the boys start causing problems, being a constant annoyance to their uncle.\n\nDonald consults a book entitled Modern Child Training, and tries to use the suggestions to gain control over his nephews, but things only get worse. In the end, after the boys leave and with his house left almost destroyed, Donald spots a page which reads ""After all, little children are only angels without wings"". This so enrages Donald that he rips the book to pieces and explodes.\n\nNephews Antics\n\nThroughout the cartoon, Huey, Dewey, and Louie play tricks on their Uncle Donald in order to annoy him. They cause extensive damage throughout his house, and have fun at Donald\'s expense. Some of their activities include:\n* Playing croquet on tricycles in Donald\'s living room, breaking vases, lamps, and windows\n* As Donald plays the piano to try to calm his nephews, the boys pick up instruments to play along with him, however Dewey uses his trombone to launch an apple at Donald, and Huey uses his cello to project his bow at Donald\n* While Donald plays the piano, Huey fills a bag with water, and Louie bursts it with his slingshot\n* Giving Donald a pie full of scorching hot mustard, then, to cool him down, they throw water on him and spray him in the face with a fire extinguisher, then throw his book at him and ride away on their tricycles\n\nAvailability\n\n* Walt Disney\'s Funny Factory With Huey Dewey & Louie Vol. 4\nQuestion:\nWhat are the names of Donald Duck\'s three nephews?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 3135, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 3135, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 8}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

It is similar to Blue Stilton cheese, except that it does not use pasteurised milk or factory-produced rennet.  The name comes from a form of the name of Stilton village in the 1086 Domesday Book (Stichiltone/Sticiltone), as the name Stilton cannot legally be used for the cheese. \n\nRandolph Hodgson of Neal\'s Yard Dairy and American Joe Schneider produce Stichelton in small batches in a dairy at Cuckney on the northern edge of Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire. They use raw milk, rennet from calves\' stomachs and hand-ladling and smoothing.\n\nHistory \n\nAlthough most Stilton cheeses have been made with pasteurised milk for many years, until 1989 the Colston Bassett dairy did make one Stilton with unpasteurised milk. However, following an outbreak of food poisoning incorrectly linked to the dairy  and subsequently revealed to be unfounded,http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2007/dec/18/rhapsodyinblue The Guardian Unlimited, 18 December 2007 they decided to end production of the unpasteurised cheese. In 1996, this decision was permanently enshrined when Stilton was awarded Protected Designation of Origin status by the EU, with one of the criteria being the use of pasteurised cows milk. \n\nStichelton is produced by a partnership including Randolph Hodgson who owns the specialist cheese retailer Neal\'s Yard Dairy, and Joe Schneider who is an American who had been a cheesemaker in the Netherlands and the UK. In late 2004 Schneider and Hodgson discussed the possibility of recreating an unpasteurised Stilton-style cheese. They eventually found premises in which to start their dairy, on the Welbeck Abbey Estate near Worksop in Nottinghamshire.\n\nUnable to be described as a Stilton, the new cheese was named Stichelton, which its makers say was based on the original name of the village of Stilton (the spelling Stichelton appears in the 13th century Lincoln Rolls). The first Stichelton cheese was produced in October 2006,  reportedly from a starter culture obtained from the original producer by Hodgson\'s colleague, and subsequently kept alive for fifteen years.http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/the-cheesemonger/the-cheesemonger-stichelton-046208 The Cheesemonger Website\n\nManufacture \n\nStichelton is made in a dairy, from the unpasteurised milk of Friesian-Holstein cows at Collinthwaite Farm, on the Welbeck Estate in Nottinghamshire. ForbesLife magazine described it as a ""sumptuous cheese that sets a full-flavored, succulent, complex chain of sensations going in your mouth: fruity and salty, buttery, and earthy, sharp and creamy. Robin Hood never had it so good."" The starter culture for the cheese is known as MT36, the original culture used in the pre-1989 unpasteurised Stiltons, and is different from the culture that is used in modern pasteurised ones.  MT36 was nearly lost, but a vial of it was sent to Ray Osborne, a starter producer, who kept it alive for 18 years.\nQuestion:\nSaga and Stichelton are types of which foodstuff?\nAnswer:\nCheeses\nPassage:\nRealgar\nRealgar, α-As4S4, is an arsenic sulfide mineral, also known as ""ruby sulphur"" or ""ruby of arsenic"". It is a soft, sectile mineral occurring in monoclinic crystals, or in granular, compact, or powdery form, often in association with the related mineral, orpiment (As2S3). It is orange-red in color, melts at 320\xa0°C, and burns with a bluish flame releasing fumes of arsenic and sulfur. Realgar is soft with a Mohs hardness of 1.5 to 2 and has a specific gravity of 3.5. Its streak is orange colored. It is trimorphous with alacranite and pararealgar.\nIts name comes from the Arabic rahj al-ġār (,  ""powder of the mine""), via Catalan and Medieval Latin, and its earliest record in English is in the 1390s. \n\nOccurrence \n\nRealgar most commonly occurs as a low-temperature hydrothermal vein mineral associated with other arsenic and antimony minerals. It also occurs as volcanic sublimations and in hot spring deposits. It occurs in association with orpiment, arsenolite, calcite and barite.\n\nIt is found with lead, silver and gold ores in Hungary, Bohemia and Saxony. In the US it occurs notably in Mercur, Utah; Manhattan, Nevada and in the geyser deposits of Yellowstone National Park.\n\nIt is commonly held that after a long period of exposure to light realgar changes form to a yellow powder known as pararealgar (β-As4S4). It was once thought that this powder was the yellow sulfide orpiment, but has been recently shown to be a distinct chemical compound.\n\nUses\n\nRealgar, orpiment, and arsenopyrite provide nearly all the world\'s supply of arsenic as a byproduct of smelting concentrates derived from these ores.\n\nRealgar was used by firework manufacturers to create the color white in fireworks prior to the availability of powdered metals such as aluminium, magnesium and titanium. It is still used in combination with potassium chlorate to make a contact explosive known as ""red explosive"" for some types of torpedoes and other novelty exploding fireworks branded as \'cracker balls\', as well in the cores of some types of crackling stars.\n\nRealgar is toxic. The ancient Greeks, who called it ""sandaracha"", understood it is poisonous. It was used to poison rats in medieval Spain and in 16th century England.  It is still sometimes used to kill weeds, insects, and rodents,  even though more effective arsenic-based agents are available.\n\nThe Chinese name for realgar is xionghuang 雄黃, literally \'masculine yellow\', as opposed to orpiment which was \'feminine yellow\'. Its toxicity was also well known to them, and it was frequently sprinkled around houses to repel snakes and insects, as well as being used in Chinese medicine.  Realgar is mixed with rice liquor to make realgar wine, which is consumed during the Dragon Boat Festival in order to ward off evil, alluding to its repellent properties. (This practice has become rarer in modern times, with the awareness that realgar is a toxic arsenic compound.)\n\nRealgar was commonly applied in leather manufacturing to remove the hair from animal pelts. Because realgar is a known carcinogen, and an arsenic poison, and because competitive substitutes are available, it is rarely used today for this purpose.\n\nRealgar was, along with orpiment, a significant item of trade in the ancient Roman Empire and was used as a red paint pigment. Early occurrences of realgar as a red painting pigment are known for works of art from China, India, Central Asia, and Egypt. It was used in European fine-art painting during the Renaissance era, a use which died out by the 18th century.   It was also used as medicine.\n\nOther traditional uses include manufacturing lead shot, printing and dyeing calico cloth.\n\nRealgar gallery \n\nFile:Realgar-151586.jpg|Realgar, gemmy crystals on calcite, 8.9 x 6.9 x 3.6 cm.

His progress was helped when the favourite, Must, and a previous winner, Early Mist, fell early on. \n\nHe went to the front of the race with three jumps remaining, cleared the last half a length ahead of E.S.B., and took a commanding lead on the final stretch. Then, in front of the royal box just 40 yards from the winning post and five lengths ahead, he suddenly inexplicably jumped into the air and landed on his stomach, allowing E.S.B. to overtake and win. Although jockey Dick Francis tried to cajole the horse, it was unable to continue. Afterwards, the Queen Mother said: ""Oh, that\'s racing.""  \n\nIt is still uncertain and debated to this day as to why Devon Loch jumped; some reports claimed he suffered a cramp in his hindquarters causing the collapse. Another report asserted that a shadow thrown by the adjacent water-jump fence (which horses only traverse on the first circuit of the Aintree course) may have baffled Devon Loch into thinking a jump was required and\xa0– confused as to whether he should jump or not\xa0– he half-jumped and collapsed.  Jockey Dick Francis later stated that a loud cheer from the crowd, for an expected royal winner, distracting the horse is a more likely explanation.\n\nReports that the horse had suffered a heart attack were dismissed, as Devon Loch recovered far too quickly for this to have been the case. He lived another six years, being put down during or shortly after the cold winter of 1962–3.\n\nModern use\n\n""To do a Devon Loch"" is a modern metaphor now sometimes used in sports and otherwise to explain a sudden, last-minute failure of teams or a sportsperson to complete an expected victory, for example: ""Manchester United won\'t do a Devon Loch and lose the title after beating Chelsea""  or ""Lewis Hamilton surrendering the championship having led Kimi Räikkönen by 17 points with just two races remaining was a Devon Loch calamity"".  Another example occurred ahead of the 2011 Irish presidential election when Seán Gallagher\'s campaign came undone in the final television debate, his fall from grace was compared to Devon Loch\'s fall just before the winning post in the 1956 Grand National. \n\nIn an article in The Times on 4 August 2012, Rick Broadbent wrote about the final day of the 2012 Olympics heptathlon competition: ""Jessica Ennis is almost there. It would take a Devon Loch-style collapse to deny her the gold medal now.""  Referencing Leicester City F.C.\'s position atop the Premier League table into the second half of the season, on January 23, 2016 Stuart James for The Guardian wrote, ""Without wishing to put any extra pressure on Ranieri and his players, it is starting to look as though it would take a Devon Loch-style collapse for Leicester to miss out on a place in the top four.""\nQuestion:\nWhich jockey rode \'Devon Loch\' in the 1956 Grand National?\nAnswer:\nShattered (Dick Francis novel)\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nThe Red Brigade terrorizes Italy - Apr 18, 1974 - HISTORY.com\nThe Red Brigade terrorizes Italy - Apr 18, 1974 - HISTORY.com\nThe Red Brigade terrorizes Italy\nShare this:\nThe Red Brigade terrorizes Italy\nAuthor\nThe Red Brigade terrorizes Italy\nURL\nPublisher\nA+E Networks\nOn this day in 1974, Italian prosecutor Mario Sossi is kidnapped by the Red Brigades. It was the first time that the left-wing terrorist group had directly struck the Italian government, marking the beginning of tensions that lasted for 10 years.\nThe Red Brigades were founded by college student Renato Curcio in 1969 to battle “against the imperialist state of the multinationals.” At first, the fledgling organization restricted its activities to small acts of vandalism and arson. However, in 1972, they abducted business executive Idalgo Macchiarini, releasing him a short time later with a sign that said, “Hit one to educate 100. Power to the armed populace.” The Red Brigades kidnapped several other executives in the years following.\nThe kidnapping of Mario Sossi marked the first time that the Red Brigades demanded a ransom: They insisted on the release of eight imprisoned members. After fellow prosecutor Francesco Coco agreed to the demand, Sossi was released. However, Coco reneged on the deal and infuriated the Red Brigades.\nOver the next several years, the terrorist group kidnapped 26 wealthy men and women to fund their criminal enterprises, extorting as much as $2 million for one abduction. They also got revenge on Coco, killing him in 1976. That same year, 49 members were prosecuted in Turin, prompting several retaliatory shootings against government officials.\nIn 1978, the ante was upped even further after some of the Red Brigades’ leaders were arrested. Aldo Moro, a former Italian prime minister, was kidnapped on March 16, 1978, and five bodyguards were killed in the attack. For 55 days, the terrorists made various demands while taunting Moro’s family with fake death announcements. On May 9, after their demands were refused, Moro’s body was found in the trunk of a red car in the middle of Rome. He had been shot 11 times in the chest. The Red Brigades killed seven more politicians in the next week, terrorizing the whole country of Italy.\nSixty-three persons ended up being charged with involvement in Moro’s murder. Prospero Gallinari, the actual shooter, and 22 others were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. The Red Brigades were finally crushed in the early 1980s when over 400 members were jailed.\nRelated Videos\nQuestion:\nWhich former Italian Prime Minister was kidnapped by The Red Brigade in 1978, and killed after 55 days in captivity?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 3848, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 3848, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 8}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

He had a period as a Bevin Boy down Bold Colliery before serving as a Marconi wireless operator in the Merchant Navy during World War II. After the war, having literary aspirations but not knowing how to pursue them, he became a bus driver with Liverpool City Transport;  here he worked with Harold Hargreaves Harrison, the father of George Harrison.\n\nHis first marriage in 1945 to Evelyn M Howarth was later dissolved. While still driving buses in Liverpool he met local school teacher Joan Thomas; she encouraged him to start writing by renting a typewriter for him when he could not afford to do so for himself. She hired him the cheapest available, a pink model as these were not suitable for offices because of their bright colour. The couple married in Liverpool in 1964. Initially his short stories and articles were published in Australian magazines before he made the break into writing for television.\n\nTelevision writing\n\nAbraham\'s writing for television included Coronation Street (1960), The Verdict is Yours (1962), Suspense (1963), The Villains (1964), No Hiding Place (1960-1964), Catch Hand (1964), Londoners (1965), King of the River (1966), Z-Cars (1967), The Expert (1968), The First Lady (1969), Dixon of Dock Green (1969), Counterstrike (1969), Paul Temple (1969-1970), Owen, M.D. (1971-1972), and The Onedin Line (1971-1980). \n\nThe Onedin Line\n\nAbraham had originally envisaged The Onedin Line as being about a modern shipping company with its boardroom battles and seagoing adventures, but then he discovered that almost all such companies were run by boards of anonymous executives. However, he noticed that most of these companies had their origins in the 19th century, mostly started by one shrewd and far-sighted individual who, through his own business acumen, built up a shipping line from nothing.McLeay, Alison. The World of the Onedin Line David & Charles (1977) pg 9 Abraham stated that James Onedin was not based on one individual but was rather an amalgamation of several characters. Suggested real-life inspirations include Victorian era shipping line owner James Baines & Co. of Liverpool (a leading character in the series was named \'Captain Baines\'), Sir Samuel Cunard and the Allan Line.\n\nThe Onedin Line first appeared as a one-off BBC Drama Playhouse production transmitted on 7 December 1970; this is now lost. Like the series which was to follow, it was set in Abraham\'s native Liverpool. Initially Abraham struggled to come up with a title for the drama. An article in Woman magazine published in July 1973 featured an interview with Abraham in which he recalled how he came up with the very unusual family name Onedin. He wanted something unique, he said, and had already decided to call the leading male character James but still had not found a surname. Then came some inspiration - he said:\n\nThe  drama so impressed the powers that be at the BBC that a 15-part series was commissioned, with the first episode of Series 1 being transmitted on 15 October 1971; Abraham wrote six episodes in this first series. In total he went on to write 22 of the 91 episodes, which were shown over 8 series. He continued to be involved in the series until his death in 1979.\n\nNovels\n\nAbraham wrote five of the six novels based on the series, namely The Shipmaster (1972), The Iron Ships (1974), The High Seas (1975), The Trade Winds (1977) and The White Ships (1979). \n\nThe books are not straightforward novelisations of the television episodes, since the author introduced additional material and also changed a number of details, though dialogue from the series that Abraham had penned himself is utilised. A series of Onedin short stories by Abraham, set between Series Two and Series Three, appeared in Woman magazine in 1973.\n\nAbraham had intended to write a whole series of novels about the Onedin Line, but he died in 1979 after completing the fifth book, The White Ships. The saga was eventually to have seen James and Elizabeth Onedin as two elderly autocrats, both determined not to relinquish their hold on the shipping business. Elizabeth Onedin would have still been a formidable woman in her 90s, while James Onedin would have died aged 102, leaving the family divided over control of the company.  Abraham had intended the Onedin story to continue right up to the 1970s, following the progress of the descendants of Charlotte Onedin and William Frazer, played by Laura Hartong and Marc Harrison in the TV series.\n\nAbraham, a heavy drinker, died of liver failure in 1979 aged 64 in Manley in Cheshire where he and Joan lived.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id\nVHQ7AwAAQBAJ&pgPT11&lpg\nPT11&dqcyril+abraham+onedin&source\nbl&otssjmZSBLT-P&sig\nddpgz5vQ2VvxmvNiZcaK5hUJmhQ&hlen&sa\nX&eiQzYHVY2lKoT4yQPDo4DoDQ&ved\n0CCkQ6AEwBTgK#vonepage&q\ncyril%20abraham%20onedin&f=false Dawe, Christine Merseyside\'s Own The History Press (2012)  Google Books] After Joan\'s death in 2014 Cyril Abraham\'s archive of scripts, letters and other documents became available for sale on eBay and other sites.\nQuestion:\nThe novels ‘The Shipmaster, ‘The Iron Ships’ and ‘The Trade Winds’ by Cyril Abraham, are based on which 1970’s British tv series?\nAnswer:\nMedusa (fictional ship)\nPassage:\nBurin\nBurin from the French burin meaning ""cold chisel""  has two specialised meanings for types of tools in English, one meaning a  steel cutting tool which is the essential tool of engraving, and the other, in archaeology, meaning a special type of lithic flake with a chisel-like edge which was probably also used for engraving, or for carving wood or bone.\n\nPrintmaking\n\nAn engraving burin is used predominantly by intaglio engravers, but also by relief printmakers in making wood engravings. Its older English name, still often used, is graver. The burin consists of a rounded handle shaped like a mushroom, and a tempered steel shaft, coming from the handle at an angle, and ending in a very sharp cutting face.\n\nIn use, it is typically held at approximately a 30-degree angle to the surface. The index and middle finger typically guide the shaft, while the handle is cradled in the palm. Of note is the 16th-century Flemish engraver Hendrik Goltzius, whose malformed hand was ideally suited for the cradling and guiding of a burin.\n\nBurins typically have a square or lozenge shape face, though several other types are used. A tint burin consists of a square face with teeth, enabling the creation of many fine, closely spaced lines. A stipple tool allows for the creation of  fine dots. A flat burin consists of a rectangular face, and is used for cutting away large portions of material at a time.\n\nArchaeology\n\nIn the field of lithic reduction, a burin is a special type of lithic flake with a chisel-like edge which prehistoric humans may have used for engraving or for carving wood or bone.  Burins exhibit a feature called a ""burin spall"", in which toolmakers strike a small flake obliquely from the edge of the burin flake in order to form the graving edge. Burin usage is diagnostic of Upper Palaeolithic cultures in Europe, but archaeologists have also identified it in North American cultural assemblages, and in his book Early Man in China, Prof. Dr. Jia Lanpo of Beijing University lists dihedral burins and burins for truncation among artifacts uncovered along the banks of the Liyigon river near Xujiayao.\n\nAn example of a type of burin diagnostic of the archaeological stratum where they are found is the ""Noailles"" burin,   a small multiple burin characteristic of the Upper Paleolithic cultural stage called the Gravettian, ca. 28–23,000 BP; these flake tools have been restruck and refined to give several chisellike edges and a blunt, grippable rear edge.\n\nGallery\n\n \nImage:Buril diedro.png |Dihedral burin on a blade \nImage:Burin caréné.png|Carinated burin with multiple facets \nImage:Burin 213 5 Global.jpg| Burin – Upper Paleolithic (Gravettian) (ca. 29,000–22,000 BP) – Brassempouy – Muséum of Toulouse\nQuestion:\nWho would normally use a tool called a \'Burin\' in his work?\nAnswer:\nEngraving\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nCary Grant - The Movie Database (TMDb)\nCary Grant — The Movie Database (TMDb)\nReport\nBiography\nOnce told by an interviewer, ""Everybody would like to be Cary Grant"", Grant is said to have replied, ""So would I.""\nCary Grant was born Archibald Alexander Leach in Horfield, Bristol, England, to Elsie Maria (Kingdon) and Elias James Leach, who worked in a factory. His early years in Bristol would have been an ordinary lower-middle-class childhood, except for one extraordinary event. At age nine, he came home from school one day and was told his mother had gone off to a seaside resort. The real truth, however, was that she had been placed in a mental institution, where she would remain for years, and he was never told about it (he wouldn\'t see his mother again until he was in his late 20s). He left school at fourteen, lying about his age and forging his father\'s signature on a letter to join Bob Pender\'s troupe of knockabout comedians. He learned pantomime as well as acrobatics as he toured with the Pender troupe in the English provinces, picked up a Cockney accent in the music halls in London, and then in July 1920, was one of the eight Pender boys selected to go to the US. Their show on Broadway, ""Good Times,"" ran for 456 performances, giving Grant time to acclimatize. He would stay in America. Mae West wanted Grant for She Done Him Wrong (1933) because she saw his combination of virility, sexuality and the aura and bearing of a gentleman. Grant was young enough to begin the new career of fatherhood when he stopped making movies at age 62. One biographer said Grant was alienated by the new realism in the film industry. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he had invented a man-of-the-world persona and a style--""high comedy with polished words."" In To Catch a Thief (1955), he and Grace Kelly were allowed to improvise some of the dialogue. They knew what the director, Alfred Hitchcock, wanted to do with a scene, they rehearsed it, put in some clever double entendres that got past the censors, and then the scene was filmed. His biggest box-office success was another Hitchcock 1950s film, North by Northwest (1959) made with Eva Marie Saint since Kelly was by that time Princess of Monaco.\nQuestion:\nBritish-born American film actor Archibald Alec Leach was better known by which stage name?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 3208, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 3208, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 8}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

Only then did I realize these furry pets haven’t always been spinning on wheels in children’s bedrooms.\nIn fact, there are 26 species of wild hamster that run free in parts of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, including\xa0Mesocricetus auratus,\xa0the Syrian hamster, which comes from the region surrounding Aleppo, Syria —the city\xa0currently under siege amid the Middle Eastern country’s ongoing war. (Related pictures: “Syrian Cultural Sites Damaged by Conflict .”)\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the burrowing mammal as vulnerable : It has a small range, possibly less than about 1,900 square miles (5,000 square kilometers).\nThe first mention of the Syrian hamster was in 1797, when physician Alexander Russell came across them in the wild and described the rodents (though didn’t give them a name) in a publication called\xa0The Natural History of Aleppo.\nIt would be another 40 years or so until George Robert Waterhouse, curator of the London Zoological Society, formally named the species the golden hamster, according to Peter Logsdail, a hamster expert and author of Hamster Lopaedia.\nWaterhouse described an animal with soft fur and a silk-like gloss, with white feet and a tail and body colors of yellow and lead gray. Its “moustache”—what we’d call whiskers today—was black and white.\nThat pretty much covers what a modern golden hamster looks like, Logsdail told me, although nowadays there are all kinds of hues, from the chocolate tortoiseshell to the banded cinnamon. That’s why its preferred name these days is Syrian hamster, since a lot of them aren’t golden anymore.\nOut of the Wild\nSo how did the Syrian hamster get to Western Europe and America? We can thank Israel Aharoni, a zoologist who led a 1930 expedition to look for golden hamsters in Aleppo. He enlisted local Sheikh El-Beled to dig up a wheat field, where they found—at a depth of 8 feet (2.4 meters)—a golden hamster and her 11 young.\nAharoni put the family in a box, thinking that the mom would look after them. Instead, “mum did what happens when she’s disturbed—she attacked one of the babies and chewed its head off,” Logsdail said.\nSo the mother was euthanized, leaving Aharoni to raise ten babies by hand. Not surprising to most kids, the babies gnawed their way out of the wooden box, and Aharoni got nine of them back.\nOnce they were ensconced at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, another five made a jailbreak—leaving Aharoni with just four hamsters, which bred very successfully (the Syrian hamster has the shortest gestation period of any hamster, just 16 days). (Also see “ 5 Jerboa Facts: Explaining Cute Jumping Rodent .”)\nThe offspring were then sent to different universities and institutions, including the London Zoo, in the mid-1930s and into the mid-1940s they had become pets in the U.K. and the U.S.\xa0In 1971, another litter of 12 were found in Aleppo and sent to the U.S. The rest, as they say, is hamster history.\nConsidering Syrian hamsters are already rare in the wild, scientists don’t know if any remain. But I hope they’re still there underground doing what hamsters do best: outwitting us humans.\nFollow Christine Dell’Amore on Twitter and Google+ .\nKeywords\nQuestion:\nUltimately, which Middle Eastern country was the origin of all the UK’s Golden Hamsters?\nAnswer:\nالجمهورية العربية السورية\nPassage:\nWhy Does It Always Rain on Me?\n""Why Does It Always Rain on Me?"" is a song by Scottish band Travis, released as the third single from their second studio album, The Man Who.  The song became the group\'s international breakthrough single, receiving recognition around the world. It was their first Top 10 hit on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 10. The song also  peaked at number 11 in Australia, and achieved success in Japan and America. \n\nThe song was written by frontman Fran Healy who wrote the song while on holiday in Israel. He wanted to go somewhere sunny because in his hometown of Glasgow it rained all the time. In an interview at the Live 8 concert, he explained that he was spending a short holiday in the southern vacation city of Eilat, Israel in the middle of the winter.  The city is known for its hot weather even during winter time, but surprisingly it began to rain for two days during his stay. \n\nWhen Travis began to perform this song at the 1999 Glastonbury Festival, after being sunny for several hours, it began to rain exactly when the first line was sung.\n\nIn a poll by listeners of Absolute Radio the song was ranked 39th on a list of the top 100 songs of the 1990s.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe music video was directed by John Hardwick and filmed in Cornwall, with scenes filmed on Craddock Moor. The pool of water that the band jump into is part of a disused mining quarry known locally as ""Gold Digger\'s Mine"". The video features the band in a rain-soaked setting, with the band having locked frontman Healy, wearing a kilt, in the boot of a 1970s Vauxhall Viva. Healy escapes, and chases the rest of the band into a disused mining quarry. The video continues with the band being shown in a floating living room, performing the song. The video ends with the living room floating away.

Lazarets can be ships permanently at anchor, isolated islands, or mainland buildings.  In some lazarets, postal items were also disinfected, usually by fumigation.  This practice was still being done as late as 1936, albeit in rare cases. A leper colony administered by a Christian religious order was often called a lazar house, after the parable of Lazarus the beggar.\n\nLazarettos throughout history \n\nIn 1592, a lazaretto made of wooden huts was built on Manoel Island in Malta after an outbreak of the plague. It was pulled down in 1593, since the disease had subsided. In 1643, Grandmaster Lascaris built a permanent Lazzaretto in the same place to control the periodic influx of plague and cholera on board visiting ships. The hospital was subsequently improved over time, and was enlarged during the governorship of Sir Henry Bouverie in 1837 and 1838. The hospital was closed in 1929 and building still exists to this day.  There are plans for the restoration of the Manoel Island Lazaretto. \n\nAfricans imported to Savannah, Georgia during the days of the slavery typically had to wait at a quarantine station on Tybee Island, which the slave ships accessed by way of Lazaretto Creek. \n\nLazaretto Island (formerly known as Aghios Dimitrios) is located two nautical miles  north-east of Corfu (). In the early 16th century, when Corfu was under Venetian rule, a monastery was established on the islet for prevention of diseases. Later that century, the island was renamed Lazaretto, after the leprosarium that was set up there. In 1798, when the French ruled Corfu, the Russo-Turkish fleet took over the islet and ran it as a military hospital. In 1814, during the British occupation, the leprosarium was renovated and went into operation again. After the Ionian Islands were united with Greece (1864), the leprosarium only operated when needed.\n\nLazaretto Islet survives on Ithaca and another on Zakynthos.\n\nAccording to Edward Hasted in 1798, two large hospital ships (also called lazarettos), (which were the surviving hulks of forty-four gun ships) were moored in Halstow Creek in Kent. The creek is an inlet from the River Medway and the River Thames. The hospital ships watched over ships coming to England which were forced to stay in the creek under quarantine to protect the country from infectious diseases, including the plague.\n\nFidra, an uninhabited island in the Firth of Forth in eastern Scotland, has the ruins of an old chapel, dedicated to St. Nicholas, which was used as a lazaretto.[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid\n43439&strquery=fidrey#s30 British History Online]\n\nDuring the Nazi occupation of Poland, the German-run Treblinka extermination camp had a pit where new arrivals who were severely ill would be shot; the staff\'s euphemistic name for this area was the lazaret.\n\nAs of 2002, one of the few remaining lazarets in Europe is the one in Dubrovnik.\n\nIn the United States, the Philadelphia Lazaretto was built in 1799 as a response to the 1793 yellow fever outbreak. \n\nLazzarettos in Italy\n\nThe first lazaret was established by Venice in 1423  on Santa Maria di Nazareth (also called ""Nazaretum"" or ""Lazaretum"", today ""Lazzaretto Vecchio""), an island in the Venetian Lagoon.   Additionally there is Lazzaretto Nuovo, also in the lagoon.\n\nPope Clement XII commissioned the architect Vanvitelli to design and build the Lazzaretto of Ancona at the south end of the Ancona harbor.\nQuestion:\nA lazaretto which can be an isolated island or a ship at anchor near a harbor is used for what purpose for maritime travelers?\nAnswer:\nQuarantine station\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nTop 10 Blondie Songs - Ultimate Classic Rock\nTop 10 Blondie Songs\nTop 10 Blondie Songs\nREDDIT\nMichael Ochs Archives, Getty Images\nBack in the late ’70s, music was on a collision course of genres that would forever divide charts, playlists and fans. But as this list of the Top 10 Blondie Songs prove, the band seemed oblivious to it all. Or, more accurately, they were well aware that they were crossing lines — they just didn’t care. Blondie came out of New York City’s punk scene, but they were more tuneful (and pop-minded) and less artsy than most of their contemporaries. From the early-’60s girl-group pop they embraced early on through the disco beats that made them stars to the groundbreaking New Wave/hip-hop fusion of “Rapture,” they rarely stayed in one place.

Most of the major lakes in Africa lie along a continental fault line known as the East African Rift Valley, which runs through the southeastern portion of the continent, creating both spectacular mountains such as Kilimanjaro and a system of deep lakes known collectively as the Great Lakes of Africa. While not quite as large as the North American Great Lakes system, the system nonetheless looms significant in both the physical and economic geography of the continent -- and that\'s not to mention its physical beauty and stature.\nLake Victoria\nNot only is Lake Victoria the largest lake in Africa, it is the second-largest freshwater lake in terms of area in the world. Bordered by Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, it supports a diverse ecosystem of reefs and islands, including many unique species of fish. Lake Victoria is also one of the sources of the Nile River. The land around Lake Victoria is densely populated, and the lake plays an important economic role in the lives of the people there. For tourists, sport fishing for Nile perch is a major attraction, as is birdwatching.\nLake Tanganyika\nLake Tanganyika is one of the 10 largest freshwater lakes in the world and the second deepest. Long and narrow -- in fact, the longest lake in the world -- it forms the entirety of the border between Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and also borders Burundi to the north and Zambia to the south. The lake\'s warm blue waters make it especially attractive to swimmers; sport fishing is also a draw.\nLake Nyasa\nLike Lake Victoria, Lake Nyasa -- also known as Lake Malawi -- is part of the African Great Lakes system. It\'s the third-largest lake in the East African Rift Valley system, bordered by Malawi, Tanzania and Mozambique. Nyasa means ""lake"" in Bantu. The Malawi beaches are well-established tourist attractions, while Tanzanian beaches such as Matema Beach tend to be less developed.\nLake Albert\nLake Albert is also sometimes known as Lake Mobutu Sese Seko. The lake is relatively shallow, reaching only 80 feet in depth, but in terms of surface area it\'s the fourth largest of the Rift Valley lakes. Its significant also for acting as a source of the White Nile river. Lake Albert borders Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Due to the terrain, which includes steep surrounding mountains, the shores of Lake Albert are sparsely populated, and the area is off the beaten path in terms of tourism, but visitors might be interested in the wildlife and forest preserves that surround the lake, as well as Muchison Falls National Park.\nLake Chad\nLake Chad is northern Africa\'s largest lake in terms of area, but it is strikingly shallow, reaching only 34 feet at its deepest point. This is in part because Lake Chad is surrounded by the arid Sahara Desert. In fact, the exact dimensions of the lake can vary widely from year to year depending on the local drought conditions. Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria and Niger share a border with the lake. Lake Chad is a vital wildlife sanctuary, and birdwatchers will find much to occupy themselves here. The best time to visit is during the rainy season, roughly August to December, when the water level is high.\nReferences\nQuestion:\nWhich is the largest lake in Africa?\nAnswer:\nSouthern Victoria Nyanza\nPassage:\nBoy Scout Motto - U.S. Scouting Service Project\nBoy Scout Motto\nBoy Scout Motto\nBe Prepared: The Motto of the Boy Scouts of America\nExcerpted from page 54, Boy Scout Handbook, 11th ed,\n(#33105), copyright 1998 by BSA, ISBN 0-8395-3105-2\nBe Prepared.\nThat\'s the motto of the Boy Scouts.\n""Be prepared for what?"" someone once asked Baden-Powell, the founder of     Scouting,\n""Why, for any old thing."" said Baden-Powell.\nThe training you receive in your troop will help you\xa0 live up to the Scout motto.     When someone has an accident, you are prepared because of your first aid instruction.     Because of lifesaving practice, you might be able to save a nonswimmer who has fallen into     deep water.\nBut Baden-Powell wasn\'t thinking just of being ready for emergencies. His idea was that     all Scouts should prepare themselves to become productive citizens and to give happiness     to other people. He wanted each Scout to be ready in mind and body for any struggles, and     to meet with a strong heart whatever challenges might lie ahead.\nBe prepared for life - to live happily and without regret, knowing that you have     done your best. That\'s what the Scout motto means.\nPage updated on:   May 02, 2013\n© 1994-2017 - U.S. Scouting Service Project | Site Map | Disclaimer | Project Team | Contact Us | Privacy Policy\nMaterials found at U.

""Parakeets""  or ""Keets"" is the term used for younger fans of Jimmy, or children of Parrotheads.\n\nOrigin of the term\n\nThe term ""Parrot Head"" was coined in 1985 at a Jimmy Buffett concert at the Timberwolf Amphitheater in Cincinnati, OH.  Buffett has said numerous times that he attributes much of his fame to this area. At the show, Jimmy commented about everyone wearing Hawaiian shirts and parrot hats and how they kept coming back to see his shows, just like Deadheads. Timothy B. Schmit, then a member of the Coral Reefer Band, coined the term ""Parrot Head"" to describe each of those fans.\n\nActivities\n\nEvents range from single act concerts or happy hours to the annual Meeting of the Minds in Key West, Florida, which attracts approximately 3,500 Parrotheads each year.  The several day event, sponsored by the Parrot Heads in Paradise includes live music, but also a Toy Drive for the Monroe County Salvation Army, a blood drive, Zonta Walk for Breast Cancer, raffles and other events to raise money for charities. Some regional groups will focus on one or two key charities, while others may switch between several.  Environmental causes, cancer research, Alzheimer\'s research and the March of Dimes all have received large donations from Parrothead organizations.  In 2011, there were 239 Parrothead Club chapters in the United States, Canada and Australia, spanning 3 different countries, 47 states and 3 Canadian provinces. The total membership in 2011 was almost 28,000 members. In the ten-year period 2002-2011, member clubs of the international Parrothead organization raised over $26.2M to support charitable organizations, and collectively worked almost 2.9 million hours of community service.  The Pikes Peak Hash House Harriers and Harriettes have an annual Parrot Head Hash weekend hosted by Yeastee Boy and Bread Box.\nQuestion:\nIf you were a parrothead, of what musician would you be a fan of?\nAnswer:\nJimmy buffett\nPassage:\nWhat Is A Dongle? - Business Insider\nWhat Is A Dongle? - Business Insider\nprint\n3 Dongles plugged into   Google\'s Chromebook Pixel. Kevin   Smith/Business Insider\nThis week two people in the tech industry lost their jobs because of jokes gone awry at a conference.\nA couple of male developers were joking around about ""big""   dongles. When a female developer evangelist heard their jokes she   tweeted it out with their photo, complaining that they were being   rude. One of those developers lost his job, and then eventually,   so did the evangelist.\nIn the developers\' defense, the word ""dongle"" is funny. It\'s   nearly impossible to say without giggling or making childish   jokes.\nSome people in our office had heard the word before, but didn\'t   know what a dongle is. Merriam-Webster \xa0defines   a dongle\xa0as a small device that plugs into a computer and   serves as an adapter or a security measure to enable the use of   certain software.\nKevin   Smith/Business Insider\nThe term, dongle, was rumored to have originated from a 1992   advertisement for Rainbow Technologies. The ad claimed the word   dongle was derived from the name ""Don Gall."" Though untrue, this   has given rise to an urban myth, we learned from Wikipedia .\nAccording to the University of   Pennsylvania\'s language log , the earliest citation of the   word dongle began appearing in 1982:\n1982 \xa0 MicroComputer   Printout \xa0Jan. 19/2 The word ‘dongle’ has been   appearing in many articles with reference to security systems for   computer software [refers to alleged coinage in 1980].\nBut as the term \'dongle\' became more widespread its meaning   changed from strictly a scientific term to mainstream. UPenn   clarifies:\nThe current meaning   for\xa0dongle\xa0seems   to be something like ""a self-contained device that plugs into   a\xa0 port on a computer that is normally used for connections   to a separate external device"". Thus in addition to the original   serial-port dongles, and the USB dongles that Suzanne (and   Stephen Fry) wrote about, there are also\xa0 ""firewire   dongles"" , and presumably there could be dongles for any   other sort of port as well.\xa0\nSimply put, dongles are computer peripherals that plug into   your computer like a USB flash drive or a cord connecting a   computer with a printer for example.\xa0 Dongles are also huge in the video game   world because they allow consoles to have added features like   increased audio quality.\nAn Xbox 360 Audio Dongle Wikimedia   Commons\nBefore USB was the standard in   attaching PC peripherals, there were tons of different dongles   that came in various shapes and sizes.\nQuestion:\nIn computing, what is the device which is plugged into a computer which serves as an adapter or to enable the use of certain software?\nAnswer:\nDongle\nPassage:\nEast Anglian Daily Times\nThe East Anglian Daily Times is a British local newspaper for Suffolk and Essex, based in Ipswich.\n\nIt started publication on 13 October 1874,  incorporating the Ipswich Express, which had been published since 13 August 1839.

It is a vector quantity, with both magnitude and direction.\xa0 Mina De La O, Getty Images\nUpdated August 02, 2016.\nVelocity Definition\nVelocity is defined as a vector measurement of the rate and direction of motion or, in other terms, the rate and direction of the change in the position of an object. The scalar (absolute value) magnitude of the velocity vector is the speed of the motion. In calculus terms, velocity is the first derivative of position with respect to time.\nThe most common way to calculate the constant velocity of an object moving in a straight line is with the formula:\nr = d / t\nwhere\nr is the rate, or speed (sometimes denoted as v, for velocity, as in this kinematics article )\nd is the distance moved\nt is the time it takes to complete the movement\nUnits of Velocity\nThe SI units for velocity are m / s (meters per second). It may be expressed in any units of distance per time. Other units include miles per hour (mph), kilometers per hour (kph), and kilometers per second (km/s).\nSample Velocity Problem\nA physics student drops an egg off an extremely tall building.\ncontinue reading below our video\n4 Tips for Improving Test Performance\nWhat is the egg\'s velocity after 2.60 seconds?\nThe hardest part about solving for velocity in a physics problem is selecting the right equation. In this case, two equations may be used to solve the problem.\nUsing the equation:\nd = vI*t + 0.5*a*t2\nwhere d is distance, vI is initial velocity, t is time, a is acceleration (due to gravity, in this case)\nd = (0 m/s)*(2.60 s) + 0.5*(-9.8 m/s2)(2.60 s)2\nd = -33.1 m (negative sign indicates direction downward)\nNext, you can plug in this distance value to solve for velocity using the equation:\nvf = vi + a*t\nwhere vf is final velocity, vi is initial velocity, a is acceleration, and t is time. Since the egg was dropped and not thrown, the initial velocity is 0.\nvf = 0 + (-9.8 m/s2)(2.60 s)\nvf = -25.5 m/s\nAlthough it\'s common to report velocity as a simple value, remember it\'s a vector and has direction as well as magnitude. Usually, moving upward is indicated with a positive sign, and down carries a negative sign.\nRelating Velocity, Speed, and Acceleration\nSpeed, velocity, and acceleration are all related to each other. Remember:\nSpeed is a scalar quantity that indicates rate of motion distance per time. Its units are length/time.\nVelocity is a vector quantity that indicates distance per time and direction. Like speed, its units are length/time, but direction is also cited.\nAcceleration is a vector quantity that indicates the rate of change of velocity. It has dimensions of length/time2.\nQuestion:\nIn physics, \'the rate of change of position\' is a basic definition of what term?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 2440, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 2440, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 8}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

Instead, it concerns the future of the programme itself.\nJulian Fellowes, the creator of Downton, has suggested that the next series of the ITV1 drama may be its last.\nIn an interview, the screenwriter admitted there was no way he could continue to write the show’s storylines at the same time as working on his next major project – to create what has been described as an American version of the series.\nThe Gilded Age, to be set in New York in the late 19th century, has been commissioned by the US network, NBC Universal, but its production is being held up by Fellowes’s continuing commitment to Downton, which is due to return for a fifth series later this year.\nFellowes, however, who was elevated to the peerage in 2011, has now indicated that this series could be the last.\nRelated Articles\nDownton Abbey, Christmas special, review: sweet but uneventful\n25 Dec 2013\nHe dropped his bombshell during an interview in the US, last week. Asked about The Gilded Age, he said: “It will happen when Downton finishes, because I just couldn’t do both at once.”\nWhen pressed on whether this meant there would still be a fifth series of Downton, he added: “Yes. I don’t know yet if there is a season six, but it’s not going to go on forever. It won’t be Perry Mason.”\nFellowes has combined his Downton duties with writing a second period drama in the past.\nHowever, the resulting series, Titanic, in 2012, was received with markedly less favour than the ongoing saga of the Crawley family.\nNews of Downton Abbey’s possible demise will alarm fans of the show, as well as managers at ITV, where it has been one of the channel’s biggest successes of recent years, coping with the loss of some of its leading characters as actors have departed, among them Dan Stevens, who played Matthew Crawley, and Jessica Brown Findlay, who played Lady Sybil.\nThe most recent series, which ended in the autumn, had average viewing figures of 11.8 million, and the Christmas Day special was watched by about seven million. Since its beginning in 2010, the show has been sold in more than 220 territories worldwide and has been a notable success in the US, becoming the highest-rated drama series in the history of its broadcaster, PBS.\nIts popularity there has led to heightened interest in The Gilded Age project, and it emerged last February that Fellowes had signed up to write and produce the drama.\nThe new series takes its name from the period of US history from the 1870s to the turn of the 20th century, an era of great social and technological change, as well as rapid economic growth, especially in the north and west of the country.\nThe term was coined by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner in an 1873 novel they wrote to satirise what they saw as the greed and corruption of the time. Fellowes’s project will explore the rise of newly rich families who emerged during the period – some of whom became known as “robber barons” – and replaced the older, established aristocracy.\nAs with the British series, the main characters will be fictional. It had been suggested that Fellowes could hand over the main Downton Abbey writing responsibilities to others, to allow him to concentrate on US show.\nBut his latest comments, in The Wall Street Journal, have made clear he does not see that as an option.\nFellowes writes the scripts for Downton alone, although he said in the US interview that he bounces ideas off his wife. “She gets to read [the scripts] first. It only goes off to my agent after it’s been through her,” he said.\nThe last series caused controversy over a storyline in which Anna, the housemaid played by Joanna Froggatt, was raped by a guest’s valet. ITV received 200 complaints after the episode on Oct 6, while Ofcom, the media watchdog, received 250.\nOfcom decided not to pursue the complaints “after careful assessment … because they did not raise issues warranting investigation”.\nQuestion:\nWho writes the scripts for the TV series Downton Abbey?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 2711, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 2711, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 8}]",5,0.375,20224,4044.8,288.8,318,63.6,4.54,8,0.07,4,38.09303114259983,ml.g5.48xlarge,llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235,meta-textgeneration-llama-2-70b-2024-01-20-17-53-55-754,763104351884.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference:2.0.1-tgi1.1.0-gpu-py39-cu118-ubuntu20.04,s3://jumpstart-private-cache-prod-us-east-1/meta-textgeneration/meta-textgeneration-llama-2-70b/artifacts/inference-prepack/v1.0.0/,3600,/opt/ml/model,4095,4096,/opt/ml/model,1,1,inference.py,8,,,,

Infestation by Botrytis requires moist conditions. If the weather stays wet, the damaging form, ""grey rot,"" can destroy crops of grapes. Grapes typically become infected with Botrytis when they are ripe. If they are then exposed to drier conditions and become partially raisined this form of infection brought about by the partial drying process is known as noble rot. Grapes when picked at a certain point during infestation can produce particularly fine and concentrated sweet wine. Some of the finest Botrytized wines are picked berry by berry in successive tries (French for ""selections"").\n\nOrigins\n\nAccording to Hungarian legend the first aszú (a wine using botrytised grapes) was made by Laczkó Máté Szepsi in 1630. However, mention of wine made from botrytised grapes had already appeared in the Nomenklatura of Fabricius Balázs Sziksai, which was completed in 1576. A recently discovered inventory of aszú predates this reference by five years. When vineyard classification began in 1730 in the Tokaj region, one of the gradings given to the various terroirs centered on their potential to develop Botrytis cinerea.\n\nA popular myth is that the practice originated independently in Germany in 1775, where the Riesling producers at Schloss Johannisberg (Geisenheim, in the Rheingau region) traditionally awaited the say-so of the estate owner, Heinrich von Bibra, Bishop of Fulda, before cutting their grapes. In this year (so the legend goes), the abbey messenger was robbed en route to delivering the order to harvest and the cutting was delayed for three weeks, time enough for the Botrytis to take hold. The grapes were presumed worthless and given to local peasants,  who produced a surprisingly good, sweet wine which subsequently became known as Spätlese, or late harvest wine. In the following few years, several different classes of increasing must weight were introduced, and the original Spätlese was further elaborated, first into Auslese in 1787  and later Eiswein in 1858 (although Eiswein is usually made from grapes not affected by Botrytis). \n\nViticulture and uses\n\nInternationally renowned botrytised wines include the aszú of Tokaj-Hegyalja in Hungary and Slovakia (commonly called Tokaji, Tokajské or Tokay), Sauternes from France - where the process is known as pourriture or pourriture noble, and Beerenauslese or Trockenbeerenauslese wines from Germany and Austria. Other wines of this type include the Romanian Grasă de Cotnari, French Coteaux du Layon, French Monbazillac, Austrian Ausbruch and South African Noble Late Harvest (NLH). Depending on conditions the grapes may be only minimally botrytized. Botrytis has also been imported for use by winemakers in California and Australia. In some cases inoculation occurs when spores are sprayed over the grapes, while some vineyards depend on natural inoculation from spores present in the environment.\nQuestion:\nNoble Rot is a fungus affecting which fruit?\nAnswer:\nWhite Grape\nPassage:\nRide of the Valkyries\nThe ""Ride of the Valkyries"" () is the popular term for the beginning of act 3 of Die Walküre, the second of the four operas by Richard Wagner that constitute Der Ring des Nibelungen.\n\nAs a separate piece, the ""Ride"" is often heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes. Together with the ""Bridal Chorus"" from Lohengrin, the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" is one of Wagner\'s best-known pieces.\n\nContext \n\nIn the Walküre opera, the ""Ride"", which takes around eight minutes, begins in the prelude to the third act, building up successive layers of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal a mountain peak where four of the eight Valkyrie sisters of Brünnhilde have gathered in preparation for the transportation of fallen heroes to Valhalla. As they are joined by the other four, the familiar tune is carried by the orchestra, while, above it, the Valkyries greet each other and sing their battle-cry. Apart from the song of the Rhinemaidens in Das Rheingold, it is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner\'s Ring cycle.\n\nPerformance history \n\nThe complete opera Die Walküre was first performed on 26 June 1870 in the National Theatre Munich against the composer\'s intent. By January of the next year, Wagner was receiving requests for the ""Ride"" to be performed separately, but wrote that such a performance should be considered ""an utter indiscretion"" and forbade ""any such thing"".  However, the piece was still printed and sold in Leipzig, and Wagner subsequently wrote a complaint to the publisher Schott.  In the period up to the first performance of the complete Ring cycle, Wagner continued to receive requests for separate performances, his second wife Cosima noting ""Unsavoury letters arrive for R. – requests for the Ride of the Valkyries and I don\'t know what else.""  Once the Ring had been given in Bayreuth in 1876, Wagner lifted the embargo. He himself conducted it in London on 12 May 1877, repeating it as an encore. \n\nOutside opera \n\nIn film \n\nUses in film include the original score for The Birth of a Nation (1915),  and What\'s Opera, Doc? (1957). \n\nThe ""Ride"" is also associated with Apocalypse Now (1979),  where the 1/9 Air Cavalry regiment plays the piece of music on helicopter-mounted loudspeakers during their assault on a Vietnamese village as psychological warfare and to motivate their own troops. \n\nIn military \n\nThe ""Ride"" is the regimental quick march of the British Parachute Regiment. \n\nIn music \n\nWithin the concert repertoire, the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" remains a popular encore, especially when other Wagnerian extracts feature in the scheduled program. For example, at the BBC Proms it was performed as such by Klaus Tennstedt and the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 6 August 1992  and also by Valery Gergiev with the Kirov Orchestra on 28 August 2001. \n\nDiscography \n\nApart from where the ""Ride"" is included in the recordings of the Walküre opera, it is a very popular piece, included in various popular classics anthologies. For instance in Deutsche Grammophon\'s 1991 Classicmania two CD album (von Karajan version), and in Brilliant Classics\' 2011 Best Film Classics CD box, there included in the fifth CD, Opera at the Movies, with a reference to Apocalypse Now on the sleeve.\nQuestion:\n""Who composed """"Ride of the Valkyries""""?""\nAnswer:\nWagner\'s\nPassage:\n35th Anniversary - Thirty-Fifth Wedding Anniversary\n35th Anniversary - Thirty-Fifth Wedding Anniversary\nMost Popular Song 35 Years Ago: ""PHYSICAL"" - Olivia Newton John\nPrice of Gasoline when you were married: $1.22 / gallon\nTRADITIONAL GIFT:  According to ancient  history, coral is said to have a magical power to prevent sterility. Coral is  mostly comprised of calcium carbonate. Coral has an opaque quality to it and  can be found in pink, white, orange, red and black. Angel-skin coral is  considered one of the most valuable of all coral. It is found near Japan and  used in most fine coral jewelry. The most valuable coral is called blood coral.  Found near Italy, blood coral is the most expensive coral in the world. Any  coral that contains parts of blood coral is immediately more valuable. Red  coral defends against plague and pestilence. It is thought that uncut coral  worn around the neck will lose its color if that person is in the presence of  another person who is going to die.\nMODERN GIFT:  Jade is another gift associated with the 35th anniversary and is  emerald green in color. The two minerals that mostly comprise jade are jadeite  and nephrite. Jadeite is the more sought after and valuable of the  two. The best jadeite is found in Myanmar in Asia. Jade can also be found in  yellow, pink, purple and black. The most common color is emerald green. In  ancient times it was thought that jade protected the kidney, liver, spleen,  heart, larynx, thymus and thyroid. Jade was associated with increased body  strength and advanced longevity.\nGEMSTONE:  The emerald is known for  its brilliant green shine. This shine comes from a high content of chromium.  Genuine emeralds contain trace amounts of iron, which actually increases the  value of the stone. Some of the best emeralds in the world are found in South  America, particularly Columbia and Brazil. Ancient Egyptians buried emeralds  with mummies. Some of the oldest emeralds in the world were harvested from the  infamous “Cleopatra mines”. Emeralds are known to be very tough gems, but they  are prone to cracks on the surface, which could devalue the gem. For this  reason, before the gems are sold to the public, they are treated with epoxy or  oils to fix or prevent any cracks and improve the transparency.\nWe hope that you have  enjoyed reading this historical information about the 35th wedding anniversary.

She has climbed Mount Fuji in Japan as well as the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps, among others. By 1972, Tabei was a recognized mountain climber in Japan.\n\nEverest expedition\n\nThe team of JWEE (Japanese Women’s Everest Expedition) consisted of fifteen, mostly working women including teachers, a computer programmer and a juvenile counselor. Two of them, including Tabei, were mothers.  JWEE, headed by Eiko Hisano, was a part of the Ladies Climbing Club, founded in 1969. After successful summit of Annapurna III on May 19, 1970 by Tabei and Hiroko Hirakawa,  LCC decided to attack Mount Everest.\n\nAlthough they obtained last-minute funding from Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper and Nippon Television, all the members still had to pay an amount that was almost equal to Japan’s average salary. To save money, they would use recycled car sheets to sew up water-proof pouches and over-gloves. They purchased goose feather from China and made their own sleeping bags. Students at school collected unused packets of jam for their teachers. \n\nAfter a long training period, they began the expedition early in 1975 when they traveled to Kathmandu. They used the same route Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay took in 1953.\n\nIn early May the women were camping at 6,300 meters when an avalanche struck their camp. The women, including Tabei and the guides, were buried under the snow. Tabei lost consciousness for approximately six minutes until her Sherpa guide dug her out. Twelve days after the avalanche, Tabei became the first female to reach the summit of Mount Everest.\n\nLater activities\n\nOn 28 June 1992 Tabei finished the climb of Puncak Jaya to become the first woman to complete the Seven Summits. \n\nTabei had a goal to climb the highest peak in every country in the world and continues to work on ecological concerns. Tabei is the director of Himalayan Adventure Trust of Japan, an organization working on a global level to preserve mountain environments.\nQuestion:\nIn 1975, Junko Tabei became the first woman to reach the summit of which mountain?\nAnswer:\nMt.

Fielding never admitted to writing the work, but it is widely considered to be his.  It is a direct attack on the then-popular novel Pamela (1740) by Fielding\'s contemporary and rival Samuel Richardson and is composed, like Pamela, in epistolary form.\n\nPublishing history\n\nShamela was originally published anonymously on 4 April 1741 and sold for one shilling and sixpence. A second edition came out on 3 November that same year which was partly reimpressed and partly reset where emendations were made.\n\nA pirated edition was printed in Dublin in 1741 as well. Reprint editions have subsequently appeared as texts for academic study.\n\nPlot summary\n\nShamela is written as a shocking revelation of the true events which took place in the life of Pamela Andrews, the main heroine of Pamela. From Shamela we learn that, instead of being a kind, humble and chaste servant-girl, Pamela (whose true name turns out to be Shamela) is in fact a wicked and lascivious creature and former prostitute, scheming to entrap her master, Squire Booby, into marriage.\n\nThemes and style\n\nThe novel is a sustained parody of, and direct response to, the stylistic failings and moral hypocrisy that Fielding saw in Richardson\'s Pamela. Reading Shamela amounts to re-reading Pamela through a deforming magnifying glass; Richardson\'s text is rewritten in a way that reveals its hidden implications, to subvert and desecrate it.  \n\nRichardson\'s epistolary tale of a resolute servant girl, armed only with her \'virtue\' to battle against her master\'s attempts at seduction, had become an overnight literary sensation in 1741. The implicit moral message – that a girl\'s chastity has eventual value as a commodity – as well as the awkwardness of the epistolary form in dealing with ongoing events, and the triviality of the detail which the form necessitates, were some of the main targets of Fielding\'s travesty.\n\nRecent criticism has explored the ways in which Pamela in fact dramatises its own weaknesses. From this perspective, Fielding\'s work may be seen as a development of possibilities already encoded in Richardson\'s work, rather than a simple attack.  Another novel by Fielding parodying Pamela, albeit not so explicitly, is The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews and his Friend, Mr. Abraham Adams (February 1742), more commonly known as Joseph Andrews.\nQuestion:\n‘Shamela’ (1741) was a parody of ‘Pamela’ (1740).

In 1920, the average water level was about 26 meters (85 feet) below sea level. By 1977, the water level had dropped by about 3 meters (10 feet). Then, it rose over the next two decades flooding infrastructure, causing large amounts of economic damage, and forcing tens of thousands of people to move. Then in the mid-1990s, the Caspian Sea began dropping again. The water level now stands at about 27 meters below sea level.\nWith global climate change looming in the coming decades, researchers are attempting to understand all the factors that control the water level on the Caspian. Key factors include: how much rain falls; how much water gets diverted into reservoirs for human use; how much water evaporates before reaching the lake; how do tectonic activity and oil extraction change the height of the land.\nNew research suggests that dust storms may have an effect as well. A study by scientists from the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics and from Istanbul Technical University details how airborne dust affects the region’s climate and water cycle in several ways. For instance, dust particles absorb sunlight, so a cloud of dust can change the distribution of heat in the atmosphere. Specifically, dust clouds warm the atmosphere and cool the water surface below. Such changes reduce the amount of evaporation at the water surface, make the atmosphere less turbulent, and reduce convection (heat rising in the atmosphere). Together, these changes reduce the likelihood of rain.\nThe researchers concluded that dust storms over the Caspian Sea likely reduce lake surface temperatures by 1 to 2 degrees Celsius (1.8  to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), while increasing evaporation by about 0.5 millimeters (0.02 inches) per day. This can lead to a drop in lake levels equivalent to 10 millimeters (0.4 inches) per year. In their model, the researchers used observations of dust collected by several satellites sensors, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites, the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), and the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWIFS).\nOn June 6, 2016, the MODIS instrument on NASA’s Aqua satellite captured this image of a thick layer of dust over the southern Caspian Sea.  Notice how the dust has almost completely obscured the water. The dust particles absorb heat from the Sun rather than allowing it to heat the water surface. Dust storms like this are common over the Caspian in spring and summer.\nReferences\nQuestion:\nWhat body of water is 86 feet (26 meters) below sea level?\nAnswer:\nApsheron Threshold\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nThe Ten Commandments (1956) on iTunes\nThe Ten Commandments (1956) on iTunes\nOpen iTunes to preview, buy, and download this movie.\nAbout the Movie\nBased on the Holy Scriptures, with additional dialogue by several other hands, The Ten Commandments was the last film directed by Cecil B. DeMille. The story relates the life of Moses, from the time he was discovered in the bullrushes as an infant by the pharoah\'s daughter, to his long, hard struggle to free the Hebrews from their slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. Moses (Charlton Heston) starts out ""in solid"" as Pharoah\'s adopted son (and a whiz at designing pyramids, dispensing such construction-site advice as ""Blood makes poor mortar""), but when he discovers his true Hebrew heritage, he attempts to make life easier for his people. Banished by his jealous half-brother Rameses (Yul Brynner), Moses returns fully bearded to Pharoah\'s court, warning that he\'s had a message from God and that the Egyptians had better free the Hebrews post-haste if they know what\'s good for them. Only after the Deadly Plagues have decimated Egypt does Rameses give in. As the Hebrews reach the Red Sea, they discover that Rameses has gone back on his word and plans to have them all killed. But Moses rescues his people with a little Divine legerdemain by parting the Seas. Later, Moses is again confronted by God on Mt. Sinai, who delivers unto him the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile, the Hebrews, led by the duplicitous Dathan (Edward G. Robinson), are forgetting their religion and behaving like libertines. ""Where\'s your Moses now?"" brays Dathan in the manner of a Lower East Side gangster. He soon finds out. A remake of his 1923 silent film, DeMille\'s The Ten Commandments may not be the most subtle and sophisticated entertainment ever concocted, but it tells its story with a clarity and vitality that few Biblical scholars have ever been able to duplicate. It is very likely the most eventful 219 minutes ever recorded to film\x97and who\'s to say that Nefertiri (Anne Baxter) didn\'t make speeches like, ""Oh, Moses, Moses, you splendid, stubborn, adorable fool""?\nCredits\nAverage Rating: 7.5/10\nTop Critics\' Reviews\nFresh: DeMille remains conventional with the motion picture as an art form.

It is first sung in the musical by the character Alex Dillingham, which was originated by Michael Ball in both the London and Broadway casts.  The song was released as a single in 1989, also sung by Ball,  and stayed in the UK singles chart for 14 weeks, peaking at #2 and becoming Ball\'s signature tune.  The song was later featured on Ball\'s 1992 self titled debut album and Love Changes Everything: The Collection.   \n\nIn the prologue to Aspects of Love, a young Englishman, Alex, is lovestruck by a French actress, Rose. This upends his world, and he sings that ""Love changes everything ... How you live and / How you die"" for better or for worse.  He notes that love ""Makes fools of everyone"" and concludes that, once love strikes, ""Nothing in the / World will ever / Be the same.""  Musically, it is a ""simple, effective three-chord piano-accompanied anthem"".  The song became the best-known number from Aspects of Love and it ""delivered yet more proof that Andrew Lloyd Webber could deliver soaring, anthemic ballads"".  \n\nThe song was featured at the 44th Tony Awards.  Artists who have covered it include Jonathan Antoine, John Barrowman, Sarah Brightman, Michael Crawford, Il Divo (with Michael Ball), Audra McDonald, Nana Mouskouri, Marti Webb, Opportunity Knocks winner Mark Rattray, Anthony Warlow, and Hayley Westenra.  The Off-Broadway spoof revue Forbidden Broadway picked up on the bed-hopping aspect of Aspects of Love, changing the song to ""We Sleep with Everyone"". \n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nFrom which show does Love Changes Everything come from?\nAnswer:\nAspects Of Love\nPassage:\nSmallest Island Nation | Dimensions Info\nSmallest Island Nation | Dimensions Info\nSmallest Island Nation\nThe smallest island nation is Nauru (official title is Republic of Nauru). The total area is 21 square kilometers (8.1 sq mi). The December 2 to 6 census puts the population at 9,275. The 2009 estimate is 14,019. The density is 476.2/km2. The island can be found at the South Pacific.\nGeneral Information\nNauru is the tiniest independent republic on the planet. It also holds the distinction of being the only republic that doesn’t have a capital. Based on archaeological findings, the island was first inhabited by Polynesians and Micronesians over 3,000 years ago. A dozen tribes were on the island. This can be seen by the 12 points on its flag.\nEarly History\nThe smallest island nation in the world had its first European visitor in 1798. It was a whaler named Captain John Fearn. Other Europeans would get wind of it. European criminals and deserters would often escape to the island.\nThe local inhabitants began trading food for firearms. This practice would lead to a tribal war. The Nauruan Tribal War lasted for ten years. It devastated the island and reduced the population by 1/3.\nThe 1800s and World War I\nThe war ended in 1888 when the nation fell under German rule. The war ended when the Germans forbade firearms and alcohol. The island nation became part of the German Marshall Islands Protectorate. Christian missionaries began arriving that year as well.\nThe Germans lost Nauru to the UK during World War I. The island nation would become part of the UK, Australia and New Zealand. These countries took control of the phosphate mining in Nauru.\nWorld War II and Independence\nThe country fell to the Japanese in World War II. Over a thousand native inhabitants were sent to the Chuuk Islands for slave work. It was liberated by the Allies in 1945.\nThe UN designated administrative rights to the UK, New Zealand and Australia. Nauru was granted independence in 1966. Operation and ownership of the phosphate deposits were given to the country.\nPopulation\nIndigenous peoples make up most of the country’s population. 58% are native to the island while 26% are Pacific Islanders. Europeans and some Chinese constitute the remaining eight percent. The dominant religion is Christianity.\nThe smallest island nation also has numerous minority religions. The most prominent is Baha\'i. The per capita income is $2,500 (2006 estimates). It still doesn’t have a capital, but Yaren is the seat of government. It is also the most populated area.\nFollow Us!\nQuestion:\nAt 21 square kilometers, which is the world\'s smallest island nation?\nAnswer:\nList of islands of Nauru\nPassage:\nQuality control\nQuality control, or QC for short, is a process by which entities review the quality of all factors involved in production. ISO 9000 defines quality control as ""A part of quality management focused on fulfilling quality requirements"". \n\nThis approach places an emphasis on three aspects:\n# Elements such as controls, job management, defined and well managed processes,   performance and integrity criteria, and identification of records\n# Competence, such as knowledge, skills, experience, and qualifications\n# Soft elements, such as personnel, integrity, confidence, organizational culture, motivation, team spirit, and quality relationships.\n\nControls include product inspection, where every product is examined visually, and often using a stereo microscope for fine detail before the product is sold into the external market. Inspectors will be provided with lists and descriptions of unacceptable product defects such as cracks or surface blemishes for example.\n\nThe quality of the outputs is at risk if any of these three aspects is deficient in any way.\n\nQuality control emphasizes testing of products to uncover defects and reporting to management who make the decision to allow or deny product release, whereas quality assurance attempts to improve and stabilize production (and associated processes) to avoid, or at least minimize, issues which led to the defect(s) in the first place. For contract work, particularly work awarded by government agencies, quality control issues are among the top reasons for not renewing a contract. \n\nNotable approaches to quality control\n\nThere is a tendency for individual consultants and organizations to name their own unique approaches to quality control—a few of these have ended up in widespread use:\n\nQuality control in project management\n\nIn project management, quality control requires the project manager and/or the project team to inspect the accomplished work to ensure its alignment with the project scope.  In practice, projects typically have a dedicated quality control team which focuses on this area.\nQuestion:\nWhat does T.Q.C. mean in manufacturing industry ?\nAnswer:\nQuality Standards\nPassage:\nJerry Kasenetz\nJerry Kasenetz (born May 5, 1943, Brooklyn, New York) is an American bubblegum pop producer who worked with Jeff Katz, the two working together as the Super K Productions company,  to manufacture and produce bands such as Shadows of Knight, Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus, The Music Explosion, 1910 Fruitgum Company, Crazy Elephant, and The Ohio Express.\nQuestion:\nThe name of what genre has its origin in what producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz had in their mouths when they discussed music targeting the younger crowd?\nAnswer:\nBubblegum Pop/Bubblegum Rock\nPassage:\nKielder Water\nKielder Water   is a large artificial reservoir in Northumberland in North East England.  It is the largest artificial lake in the United Kingdom by capacity and it is surrounded by Kielder Forest, the largest man-made woodland in Europe. The scheme was planned in the late 1960s to satisfy an expected rise in demand for water to support a booming UK industrial economy. But the decline of traditional heavy industry, together with more water-efficient industrial processes and better control of water supply leakage, served to undermine the original justification for the reservoir and many came to criticise the government-funded project as a white elephant. \n\nKielder Water is owned by Northumbrian Water, and holds 200 billion litres (44 billion gallons, or 0.2 cubic km), making it the largest reservoir in the UK by capacity (Rutland Water is the largest by surface area).  It has a  shoreline, and is 39.7 km (24.6 miles) from the sea. \n\nConstruction\n\nAfter the scheme was approved by Parliament in 1974, work to build the reservoir and the dam in the Kielder Valley began in 1975. The reservoir and dam was designed for Northumbrian Water by consulting engineers Babtie, Shaw and Morton.     with Sir Frederick Gibberd and Partners as consulting architect.  Earth moving and infrastructure construction was undertaken in a joint venture with AMEC and Balfour Beatty. \n\nThe design meant the loss of numerous farms and a school. The former permanent way of the Border Counties Railway was also taken away through the development of the reservoir.\n\nWork was completed in 1981. Elizabeth II officially opened the project the following year. The valley took a further two years to fill with water completely.\n\nHydro electric plant\n\nKielder Water is also the site of England\'s largest hydro electric plant. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 26 May 1982 and is owned by Northumbrian Water. In December 2005, RWE Npower Renewables bought the rights to operate the plant and sell the electricity generated by it, with a contract lasting until 2025. Following the takeover, the turbines were refurbished in 2005–2006, which increased the efficiency of the electricity generation. Controls were also updated, meaning that the plant can be operated from Dolgarrog in Wales.\n\nThe plant generates electricity using dual turbines which produce 6 megawatts (MW) of electricity. This comes from a combination of a 5.5\xa0MW Kaplan turbine, which generates electricity when water release takes place, and a 500 kilowatt (kW) Francis turbine that generates constantly from the compensation flow of water from the reservoir into the North Tyne. This gives the reservoir an average production of 20,000\xa0MWh of electricity per year, a saving of 8,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year compared to fossil fuel based methods of generation.\n\nOperations\n\nThe reservoir\'s main use is to provide compensating discharges into the North Tyne to support abstractions of water further downstream. It also underpins the £167m Kielder Transfer Scheme, where water can be transferred to the Wear and the Tees rivers, to meet shortfalls in those areas. In recent years, Kielder Water has become increasingly important, with underground springs ensuring that it always remains at high levels, regardless of the prevailing climate condition. This means that while the south of England is often forced to implement drought strategies and hosepipe bans, north east England enjoys plentiful water supplies.\n\nThere are two main visitor centres at Kielder Water—Leaplish waterside park and Tower Knowe visitor centre—and other facilities at Kielder, Falstone and Stannersburn villages. It is also one of the region\'s major tourist venues, attracting more than 250,000 visitors a year who come to enjoy the wide range of leisure opportunities on offer.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\n=\nQuestion:\nKielder Water is the largest artificial lake in the UK.

He then studied at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where Friedrich Walchner\'s lectures first stimulated his interest in chemistry. Next he attended the school of commerce in Leipzig, where he studied chemistry under Otto Linné Erdmann, who further developed his interest into a passion for questions of speculative chemistry.\n\nReturning home in 1834, he entered his father’s white lead factory, but soon found that business was not to his liking, and after a sharp disagreement with his father in his 20th year he enlisted in a cavalry regiment. In a few months military life became equally distasteful, and he purchased his discharge with the assistance of the German chemist Justus von Liebig. After a short period of living in Dresden, he went to the University of Giessen in central Germany in 1836 to study and work in Liebig\'s laboratory. His stay at Giessen lasted 18 months, and in 1837 he re-entered the factory. Again, however, he quarrelled with his father, and in 1838 he went to Paris with introductions from Liebig.\n\nIn Paris, he attended Jean Baptiste Dumas’ lectures and worked with Auguste Cahours (1813–1891) on essential oils, especially cumin, in Michel Eugène Chevreul’s laboratory at the Jardin des Plantes, meanwhile earning a precarious living by teaching and making translations of some of Liebig’s writings. In 1841, through the influence of Dumas, he was charged with the duties of chemistry professor at the Montpellier faculty of sciences, becoming titular professor in 1844.\n\nIn 1842 he annoyed his friends in Paris by the matter and manner of a paper on the classification of organic compounds. Later, he published Précis de chimie organique (1844–1845). In 1845 he and his opinions were the subject of an attack by Liebig, unjustifiable in its personalities but not altogether surprising in view of his wayward disregard of his patron’s advice. The two were reconciled in 1850, but his faculty for disagreeing with his friends did not make it easier for him to get another appointment after resigning the chair at Montpellier in 1851, especially as he was unwilling to go into the provinces.\n\nHe obtained leave of absence from Montpellier in 1848 so that he could pursue without interruption his special investigations, and from that year until 1855 he resided in Paris. During that period he established an École de chimie pratique (""School for practical chemistry"") for which he had great hopes. However, these hopes were disappointed, and in 1855, after refusing the offer of a chair of chemistry at the new Zürich Polytechnic in 1854, he accepted the professorships of chemistry at the Faculty of Sciences and the École Polytechnique at Strassburg, where he died the following year, having just completed checking the proofs for Traité de chimie organique (4 vols., Paris, 1853–56), his magnum opus. This latter work embodies all his ideas and his discoveries.\n\nWork\n\nGerhardt is known for his work on reforming the notation for chemical formulas (1843–1846). He also worked on acid anhydrides, and synthesized acetylsalicylic acid, albeit in an unstable and impure form.\n\nGerhardt is usually linked with his contemporary, Auguste Laurent, with whom he shared a strong and influential interest in chemical combination.\n\nDeath\n\nHe died on August 19, 1856, two days short of his birthday, after being poisoned by his own chemicals during laboratory work. He was 39 years old.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\n""in 1853 while working on the synthesis and properties of various acid anhydrides, French chemist Charles Frederic Gerhardt made acetylsalicylic acid by mixing acetyl chloride with a sodium salt of salicylic acid (sodium salicylate). He called the resulting compound """"salicylic-acetic anhydride"""".

It is best known as the location of Claude Monet\'s garden and home.\n\nLocation\n\nGiverny sits on the ""right bank"" of the River Seine where the river Epte meets the Seine. The village lies 80 km from Paris, west and slightly north, in the old province of Normandy (it is officially in the département of Eure, in the région of Haute-Normandie).\n\nHistory\n\nA settlement has existed in Giverny since neolithic times and a monument uncovered attests to this fact. Archeological finds have included bootees dating from Gallo-Roman times and to the earlier 1st and 2nd centuries AD. The town was known in ancient deeds as ""Warnacum"". The cultivation of grapes has been an occupation of the inhabitants of Giverny since Merovingian times. The village church dates from the Middle Ages and is built partially in the Romanesque style, though additions have since been made. It is dedicated to Sainte-Radegonde. The village has remained a small rural setting with a modest population (numbering around 301 in 1883 when Monet discovered it) and has since seen a boom in tourism since the restoration of Monet\'s house and gardens.\n\nMonet at Giverny\n\nClaude Monet noticed the village of Giverny while looking out of a train window. He made up his mind to move there and rented a house and the area surrounding it. In 1890 he had enough money to buy the house and land outright and set out to create the magnificent gardens he wanted to paint. Some of his most famous paintings were of his garden in Giverny, famous for its rectangular Clos normand, with archways of climbing plants entwined around colored shrubs, and the water garden, formed by a tributary to the Epte, with the Japanese bridge, the pond with the water lilies, the wisterias and the azaleas.\n\nMonet lived in the house with its famous pink crushed brick façade from 1883 until his death in 1926. He and many members of his family are interred in the village cemetery.\n\nThe Giverny Colony \n \n\nBeginning around 1887, a number of American Impressionist artists settled to work in Giverny, drawn by the landscapes, the overall atmosphere, and the presence of Monet. These included Willard Metcalf, Louis Ritter, Theodore Wendel, and John Leslie Breck.  Soon many American extended their visits from summer through the entire year.  American painter Theodore Earl Butler married Monet\'s stepdaughter and sometime-model Suzanne Hoschedé there in 1892.  \n\nFrederick Carl Frieseke spent every summer from 1906 through 1919 in a residence next door to Monet\'s.  The term Decorative Impressionism was coined in 1911 to describe Frieseke\'s work, and the term describes the work of a ""second wave"" of American painters in Giverny such as Richard E. Miller.  In December 1910, six of the Giverny artists (Frieseke, Miller, Lawton S. Parker, Guy Rose, Edmund Greacen and Karl Anderson) were given a show at the Madison Gallery in New York which termed them ""The Giverny Group.""  \n\nWorld War I largely marked the end of the art colony.\n\nAttractions\n\nClaude Monet\'s property at Giverny (house and gardens), left by his son to the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1966, became a Museum opened to public visit in 1980 after completion of large-scale restoration work: the huge Nymphea\'s studio was restored and the precious collection of Japanese engravings was displayed in several rooms, hung in the manner chosen by the master himself; the gardens were replanted as they once were.  The house became a popular tourist attraction (the Claude Monet Foundation), particularly in the summer when the flowers are in bloom.\n\nThe other main attraction of the village is the Museum of Impressionism Giverny dedicated to the history of impressionism and its continuation in the Giverny art colony and along the valley of the river Seine.\n\nThe Hôtel Baudy was a center of artistic life in the Giverny heyday. It is now still a café and restaurant, with period decoration.\n\nPopulation\nQuestion:\nWhich French painter famously designed a garden at his home in Giverny, in which he created many of his most famous paintings?\nAnswer:\nClaude-Oscar Monet\nPassage:\nGustav Klimt, The Kiss | Art History: Symbolism | Khan Academy\nGustav Klimt, The Kiss (video) | Khan Academy\nGustav Klimt, The Kiss\nPractice: Symbolism and Art Nouveau\nVideo transcript\n[MUSIC PLAYING] DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: We\'re in the Belvedere in Vienna, and we\'re looking at Gustav Klimt\'s The Kiss from 1908. Probably the most famous Klimt, and actually, I have to admit that I had forgotten that the painting was almost a perfect square, because I\'ve seen in so many posters where it\'s been cut down and made into a rectangle. DR: BETH HARRIS: It\'s a very large painting and there\'s so much gold that it\'s hard not to think of a religious icon. And I think in some ways Klimt was trying to create a modern icon-- something that suggested a sense of transcendence. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Well there\'s no question that the gold here makes you think of the Byzantine tradition, maybe some of the tile work at Ravenna. There is a way that the patterning, especially around the faces, becomes a kind of halo, as well. You have Klimt building up the gold. He\'s got those gold circles, they actually rise off the surface of the canvas. DR: BETH HARRIS: And catch the light, much the way that the gold was tooled in medieval paintings. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: There is this sense of the male figure of patterns that are direct of linear in contrast to the curvilinear to the circles and the ovals that we seen in the female form. But the point that you made about the sense of the spiritual is so powerful in this painting. I think we forget that that darker gold ground seems so much as if the figures are somehow being dissipated into the cosmos, that there are so lost in the intensity, the eternity of that kiss. DR: BETH HARRIS: And all removed from the everyday world. I mean, we have to remember that this is a time of incredible modernization in Vienna. The city of Vienna has been transformed in the previous 30 years into a modern city. Here Klimt is abstracting a universal experience from the trauma, the difficulties, the anxieties of everyday life. I think it\'s also important to see this in relationship to Klimt\'s Beethoven Frieze, where the figures confront evil forces-- these mythic figures-- and in the end, there\'s this embrace, this kiss, this emergence from evil into fulfillment and perfection. A minute ago, we were looking at the painting by Egon Schiele called The Embrace, but there there was so much more of a sense of the physicality, of the body\'s. The way that the bodies really aren\'t present here and are cloaked in these decorative forms, reminds us how much Klimt, although he was exploring this kind of sensuality, was also disguising it, or covering it with a kind of decorative patterning. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And that\'s absolutely right, with the exception of the faces. And here, this is where the entire painting changes. The female figure is completely full frontal but horizontal. So that there\'s this beautiful sense of here passivity receiving that kiss, but also a kind of deep interior feeling with her eyes closed. Her fingers just delicately touching his as he holds her head and his neck reaches out and round, and you get a sense of his physical power through the strength of that neck, but also the intensity of his desire. And of course, they\'re both crowned. As on his head you can see a wreath of leaves, on hers almost as if they were the stars of the heavens. DR: BETH HARRIS: Schiele gives us an image of a couple that\'s electrified by kind of agitated outlines. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Schiele is showing us a kind of truth through the energy of the moment. Whereas Klimt seems to be reaching out to a truth that is for all time, that is so aestheticized it feels as if it has a degree of absolute permanence.

The film was directed by Bud Pollard.\n\nThemes\nThe Black King chronicles the rise and fall of a fictionalized charismatic leader of a back-to-Africa movement, satirizing the life of Marcus Garvey. The film explores numerous critiques of Garvey\'s movement, including the lack of knowledge about Africa, the presumptuousness in making plans for future development and government in Africa without consultation of people already there, and conflicts between lighter skinned and darker skinned African Americans. While Garvey was a primarily a political leader with religious opinions, his counterpart in the film was primarily a preacher and religious leader. The film was intended to resonate with the audience\'s pre-existing disillusionment with Garvey.\n\nHistory\nThe Black King was written as a stage play by Donald Heywood and plans were publicly announced to produce it on Broadway directed by Russian choreographer Léonide Massine.

He is the god who planted the tree of life called Ulukayın. Kayra is described as both father and mother, and resides in the 17th layer of heaven.He is the supreme god of the pantheon and the son of sky deity named Tengri. This son, Kara Han (the black king or ruler of the land – Kara may mean land, earth, black or in a sense strong, powerful), left his father\'s home in the heaven and went to live in the underworld. On occasion, identified as Kara-Khan (black king), he was the primordial god and his father was the ancordial god called Tengri.\n\nEtymology\nThe name of this deity is found in several forms, as is that of his opponent. ""Kayra-Khan"" may be translated as ""merciful king"", while the form ""Kara Han"" signifies ""black king"". For this reason, authority on Turkic Mythology Deniz Karakurt, considers Kara-Han and Kayra-Han to be two different deities. Furthermore, the Turkish word kara can mean both black and land, with the result that Kara Han can mean not only \'Black (Dark) Ruler\' but also \'Ruler of the Land\'.\n\nGod of Creation\nIn ancient Turkic  belief known as Altai myth of creation, Tangri (God) Kara Han is neither male nor female nor even human in form, but a pure-white goose that flies constantly over an endless expanse of water (time), the benign creator of all that is, including the other, lesser gods. Among all Altai people the dualistic division is most clear (Ulgen and Erlik), and the highest god, Tengre Kaira Khan, is a good power. But before Ak Ana appears to urge it to create, Kara-han becomes anxious, creation occurring in a context of loneliness, turmoil and fear: the water becomes turbulent, but it reassures itself that it ""need not fear"" (the implication of such self-reassurance being that it is indeed afraid). Supreme being in the universe it created, Kara-han is the ruler of the three realms of air, water and land, seated on the seventeenth level of the universe, from which it determines the fate of its creation. After creating the universe it planted the nine-boughed tree of life, from the branches of which came the ancestors of humans. Thus emerged the nine races (nine clans).\nIt has three sons: Ulgan, Mergen and Kyzaghan.\nA Tuvinian / Soyoth legend, told as follows: The giant turtle which supported the earth moved, which caused the cosmic ocean to begin flooding the earth. An old man who had guessed something like this would happen, built a raft. Boarded it with his family, and he was saved. When the waters receded, the raft was left on a high wooded mountain, where, it is said, it remains today. After the flood Kaira-Khan created everything around the world. Among other things, he taught people how to make Araq (some kind of liquor).\n\nSee also\nBai-Ulgan\nTurul\nPassage 6:\nBlack King\nBlack King may refer to:\n\nThe black king (chess)\nA black king (playing card), either the King of Spades or the King of Clubs\nBlack King (comics), a number of comics characters\nBlack King, a character in Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror\nBlack King (Ultra monster), a kaiju from Return of Ultraman\nLampropeltis getula, the Black King Snake\nThe Black King (film), a 1932 race film starring A.B.

He is the younger brother of footballer Goran Švonja.\n\nClub career\nFrom 2016 to 2018, he played for OFK Bačka.\nPassage 2:\nAnton Shunto\nAnton Shunto (Belarusian: Антон Шунто; Russian: Антон Шунто; born 31 May 1988) is a Belarusian professional footballer who plays for Zhodino-Yuzhnoye.He is a younger brother of Denis Shunto, who is a founder and former president of Krumkachy Minsk.\n\nCareer\nShunto started his career with FC Krumkachy Minsk.\nPassage 3:\nPeter Rosegger\nPeter Rosegger (original Roßegger) (31 July 1843 – 26 June 1918) was an Austrian writer and poet from Krieglach in the province of Styria. He was a son of a mountain farmer and grew up in the woodlands and mountains of Alpl. Rosegger (or Rossegger) went on to become a most prolific poet and author as well as an insightful teacher and visionary.\nIn his later years, he was honoured by officials from various Austrian universities and the city of Graz (the capital of Styria). He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature three times. He was nearly awarded the Nobel Prize in 1913 and is (at least among the people of Styria) something like a national treasure to this day.\n\nEarly life\nRosegger was born as the first of seven children of a peasant couple in the village of Alpl, in the mountains above Krieglach, Styria. The family lived in a simple 18th-century Alpine farmhouse, called Kluppeneggerhof. Living conditions were modest, the central room was used for eating, sleeping and working. Food was prepared over a hearth in the scullery. The farmhouse is now part of the Universalmuseum Joanneum, but even today the building ensemble can only be reached by foot.\nSince this little village, consisting only of a handful of farms, had neither a church nor a school, Rosegger and the other children would have had to walk down the mountain to the larger village, St. Kathrein, in order to attend either. The way there takes two hours and as a result, Peter had very limited education, largely provided by a wandering teacher who taught him and other children from the region for a year and a half. His physical constitution was not sufficient for him to become a farmer like his father, as he was often sick and rather frail in general. So, he became understudy of a traveling tailor at the age of seventeen.\n\nSuccess as a writer\nHis interest in literature prevailed, although he earned little money. He spent what he could afford on books and soon began to write himself. Eventually, he was discovered by the publisher of the Graz-based newspaper, Tagespost, published by Dr. Svoboda. He realized Rosegger\'s talent as an author and enabled him to attend the Akademie für Handel und Industrie (Academy for Trade and Industries) in Graz.\nThere, Peter von Reininghaus became his mentor. Von Reininghaus was a wealthy and influential industrialist, and Rosegger had a personal friendship with him for the rest of his life. However, he had a hard time studying, as he was not used to attending school regularly, and had little, and fragmentary, knowledge in many disciplines. He left the academy in 1869 at the age of twenty-six.\nSoon after that, he was offered a chance to publish his literary works, namely by Gustav Heckenast, who had worked with Adalbert Stifter before. Peter Rosegger accepted, and his first book, Geschichten aus der Steiermark (""Tales from Styria""), was released in 1871. From then on, all of his works were published by Heckenast. [Presumably only until Heckenast\'s death: see next sentence?]\nRosegger changed to a new publisher twice after Heckenast\'s death, eventually ending up with Ludwig Staackmann, who made him a most generous offer. He had always been very faithful towards his publishers, and the relationship between them was one of friendship and familiarity. Rosegger started to publish Heimgarten in 1876, a monthly journal with articles and stories for the people of the country, whose main representative and interpreter he was.\n\nCharacter and private life\nIn 1873, Rosegger married Anna Pichler. They had two children, but the marriage was short - Anna died giving birth in 1875. This affected Peter to a great degree, as is obvious from various letters he wrote to friends in that time. In 1879, Rosegger married again: Anna Knaur, with whom he had three more children and a very harmonious house life. She also cared for him during his many times of sickness.\nHe developed many brilliant and extraordinary ideas from the context of his time, and kept contact with unconventional personalities. Rudolf Falb, the creator of the popular ""lunisolar flood theory,"" was not only his school teacher but remained a lifelong friend. Although feeling strongly connected to his rural homelands, he was a liberal thinker with conservative roots. Fascinated by machines and technology, and being a faithful Christian, he showed a sharp eye for the potentials and advantages, as well as for the dangers and downsides of both the church and the economic development of the late 19th century. As an author he aimed to entertain, to teach and also to help. He called for donations publicly at various occasions or used his influence in academic circles, thus contributing to the founding of one school (in Alpl, his home village), the building of two churches (one in Mürzzuschlag and one in St. Kathrein, rebuilt after it burned down) and other benevolent actions.\n\nHonors\nIn 1903, at his 60th birthday, he was honoured by receiving the ""Ehrendoktorwürde"" (Doctor honoris causa) of the University of Heidelberg. The University of Vienna and the University of Graz also awarded him with similar decorations, and the German emperor Wilhelm II, as well as the Austrian emperor Franz Josef I of Austria gave Rosegger medals of honour (namely, the ""Kronenorden 2. Klasse"" and the ""Ehrenabzeichen für Kunst und Wissenschaft""). He became citizen of honour in Graz and Vienna, and Franz Josef\'s successor Karl presented the ex-farmer-boy-now-national-poet with the Franz-Joseph-medal, a high-ranking accolade for an author.\n\nLate life and death\nRosegger, who had been ill frequently and seriously, travelled back to his home in Krieglach in May 1918 in order to die where ""the beautiful legend of the forest-farmer boy"" had once begun, in the woodlands of the Styrian Alps.\nHis birth house, the former ""Forest School"" (Waldschule) he helped to found in Alpl in 1902 and his house in Krieglach, where he lived until his death in 1918, are museums today. The region where he came from (the mountains of the Fischbacher Alps south of Krieglach and Mürzzuschlag) are now unofficially named ""Waldheimat"" (""Home in the Forest"") after the name he gave it himself. The tourism industry in the region still profits from Rosegger\'s enduring popularity among readers.\n\nSelected works\nZither und Hackbrett (poems in Styrian dialect, 1870)\nVolksleben in Steiermark (""People\'s Life in Styria""), 1875\nDie Schriften des Waldschulmeisters (""Manuscripts of a Forest-school Master""), 1875\nWaldheimat (""Home in the Forest""), 1877\nDer Gottsucher (""the God-seeker""), 1883\nHeidepeters Gabriel, 1886\nJakob der Letzte (""Jakob the Last One""), 1888\nAls ich noch jung war (""When I Was Young""), 1895\nDas ewige Licht (""the Eternal Light""), 1896\nErdsegen (""Earth\'s Blessing""), 1900\nAls ich noch der Waldbauernbub war (""When I Was a Forest-farmer Boy""), 1902\n\nFurther reading\nEindringen des Kapitalismus in ein Bauerndorf, Martin der Mann, 1889 (""Introduction of Capitalism into a Village of Farmers"", ""Martin the Man"")\nHoch vom Dachstein, 1891\nWeltgift, 1903\nINRI (Christ book), 1905\nCollected Works, 1913–16\nLetters to F. v.

On four occasions he had the boy\'s remains transferred to more honourable places, and in 1168 erected a chapel in his honour in Mousehold Wood, where the boy\'s body was said to have been found.

While treasurer, he introduced the practice of keeping Exchequer Journal rolls, or as accountants know them day books, which recorded the total amount in the treasury at the start of each day along with all payments made that day. This practice began in 1293, and did not record any payments made before taxes arrived at the treasury.William was a canon of Wells by 20 March 1291 and a royal clerk.William was elected bishop on 30 January 1293 and consecrated on 17 May 1293. As treasurer he was instrumental in putting forward administrative changes in the way the department was run. For the first time, monies coming into the treasury were recorded on special accounts and the officials of the department became more involved in the collection and assessment of taxes and other varieties of income. However, in August 1295 William was dismissed as treasurer, although the financial policies did not change. It may be that King Edward I used March as a scapegoat, or it may be that some charges that citizens of London brought against the treasurer were felt to be valid. After his dismissal from the treasurership in 1295, he devoted himself to the care of his diocese, and was regarded as a pious bishop.William died on 11 June 1302 although current historical research is challenging that date. He was buried at Wells Cathedral in the south transept wall on 17 June 1302. In 1325 there was a petition for him to be canonized, which continued to be supported by kings Edward II and Edward III. William is supposed to have built the chapter house at Wells. His will named a brother, John March, and a nephew, Robert Urry, to whom William left monies to go on crusade in William\'s name.\n\nCitations\nPassage 7:\nWilliam Middleton (bishop)\nWilliam Middleton (or William de Middleton; died 31 August or 1 September 1288) was a medieval Bishop of Norwich.\n\nLife\nMiddleton began his career as a clerk in the Jewish exchequer in 1265. He was given custody of the rolls in 1276, and in 1277 was at the French royal court. He was an official of Canterbury when he was appointed Archdeacon of Canterbury by Archbishop Robert Kilwardby in October 1275. He may also have held a prebend in the diocese of London.Middleton was elected on 24 February 1278 and was consecrated on 29 May 1278. He was enthroned at Norwich Cathedral on 27 November 1278. He continued to work on royal administrative business after his election and consecration.In July 1287 Middleton was appointed to the offices of Seneschal of Gascony and Lieutenant of the Duchy of Aquitaine. He died 31 August or 1 September 1288.\n\nCitations\nPassage 8:\nWilliam of St. Barbara\nWilliam of St. Barbara or William of Ste Barbe (died 1152) was a medieval Bishop of Durham.\n\nLife\nFrom William\'s name, it is presumed that he was a native of Sainte-Barbe-en-Auge in Calvados in Normandy (Neustria). He was a canon of York Minster in 1128. He was Dean of York by December 1138.William was elected to the see of Durham on 14 March 1143 and consecrated on 20 June 1143. He was elected in opposition to William Cumin who had been intruded into the see by King David I of Scotland in 1141. Cumin was never consecrated and by 1143 had been excommunicated by Pope Innocent II who also ordered a new election to be held at York Minster. It was this election which selected William of St. Barbara. However, the new bishop was not able to enter Durham right away, and he was enthroned either on 18 October 1144 or shortly thereafter.Troubles continued in Durham, and the bishop was unable to attend the Council of Rheims in 1148, which led to a suspension by the pope for inattendance. William supported Henry Murdac in the disputed election to the archbishopric of York, and it was probably Murdac who arranged for the suspension to be lifted. William also supported the Cistercians and the Augustinians, which perturbed  his cathedral chapter which was made up of Benedictine monks. He died 13 November 1152. A grave identified as his was excavated in the 19th century in the chapter house of  Durham Cathedral.\n\nCitations\nPassage 9:\nW. Langdon Kihn\nWilfred (or William) Langdon Kihn (September 5, 1898 – December 12, 1957) was a portrait painter and illustrator specializing in portraits of American Indians.\n\nLife and career\nHe was born in Brooklyn, New York, son of Alfred Charles Kihn and Carrie Lowe (Peck) Kihn.  He attended Boys\' High School in Brooklyn and was recognized there for his artistic talent.He married Helen Van Tine Butler in 1920, and lived in Hadlyme and Moodus, Connecticut.He studied with the Art Students League, 1916–17, and was a pupil of Homer Boss and Winold Reiss.\n\nMotivated by a desire to document the disappearing aboriginal culture, he spent many years visiting and living with Indian tribes in the Western United States.  In 1920, he was admitted to the Blackfeet tribe in Montana, under the name ""Zoi-och-ka-tsai-ya,"" meaning ""Chase Enemy in Water"".In 1922, the New York Times described his work as follows:\n\nMr. Kihn\'s portraits are marvels of incisive characterization. These closely studied physiognomies show no trace of the sentimental idealization from which most painters of Indian subjects find it almost impossible to escape. Each is firm, clear, and direct, recording the subtle differences of aspect difficult enough to discern in races other than our own, and seizing the essential message of the face with youthful certainty and conviction.\nThroughout his career, he also illustrated a number of books, including Indian Days in the Canadian Rockies by Marius Barbeau (1923) and Pocahontas and Her World by Frances Carpenter (1961). Many of his illustrations featured colorful portraits, while children\'s story books such as Flat Tail by Alice Gall and Fleming Crew (1935) often featured line drawings.\nAlong with writer Donald Barr Chidsey, he was a Democratic candidate for the Connecticut House of Representatives from the town of Lyme, in the November 2, 1948 election.He died in Lawrence Memorial Hospital, New London, Connecticut, after a short illness, and was buried in Cove Cemetery, Hadlyme, Connecticut.\n\nCollections and exhibitions\nHis paintings were featured in one-man and group exhibitions in many different museums and galleries, starting in the early 1920s.His work is in the permanent collections of, among others, the McCord Museum in Montreal, Quebec, and the Davison Art Center Gallery at Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut.In 2014, the Foosaner Art Museum at the Florida Institute of Technology hosted an exhibition of his works, featuring pictures from the Vancouver Art Gallery and the National Geographic Society and a private collector.\n\nSee also\nNative Americans in the United States: Depictions by Europeans and Americans\nNative Americans in popular culture\nElbridge Ayer Burbank\nGeorge Catlin\nSeth and Mary Eastman\nPaul Kane\nCharles Bird King\nJoseph Henry Sharp\nJohn Mix Stanley\n\nSources\nExternal links\n\nW.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. Practice regarding whether this place should be a country, a territory or a city/town/locality differs in different countries, but often city or territory is used for native-born citizen passports and countries for foreign-born ones.\nAs a general rule with respect to passports, if the place of birth is to be a country, it\'s determined to be the country that currently has sovereignty over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\nSome countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of födelsehemort (""domicile of birth"") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby\'s mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\nSimilarly, Switzerland uses the concept of place of origin. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother\'s or father\'s place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder\'s place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In Japan, the registered domicile is a similar concept.\nIn some countries (primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase jus soli. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality(-ies) of the baby\'s parents (referred to as jus sanguinis).\nThere can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality(-ies) of the parents and/or the location of the plane or ship (if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\nSome administrative forms may request the applicant\'s ""country of birth"". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant\'s ""place of birth"" or ""nationality at birth"". For example, US citizens born abroad who acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA (American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nReference list\n8 FAM 403.4 Place of Birth\nPassage 4:\nSennedjem\nSennedjem was an Ancient Egyptian artisan who was active during the reigns of Seti I and Ramesses II.

In 1746, he was accepted into the Hofkapelle of Frederick the Great and, at this time, began studying composition with his colleague, the flautist Friedrich Wilhelm Riedt.By 1754, Jacobi was employed as the principal oboist in the Hofkapelle of Frederick the Great\'s cousin, Charles Frederick Albert, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt in Berlin. On the recommendation of Johann Joachim Quantz, in 1768 King Frederick appointed Jacobi as the director of the Hautboistenschule in Potsdam, responsible for training the nearly 2,000 oboists in the Prussian army.Jacobi was a member of the ""Freitagsakademien"" (Friday academies), a musical society which met each Friday at the house of Johann Gottlieb Janitsch. For Jacobi, Janitsch was said to have composed all manner of trios, quartets and concertos in ""all the usual and unusual keys"". Such pieces allowed Jacobi to improve his skills as an oboist, and earned him a great reputation amongst Berlin\'s musical societies. Two works  by Janitsch bear a dedication to Jacobi, and several other works in extremely uncharacteristic keys for the oboe by Janitsch can be presumed to have been composed for him. They are a testament to his great skill on the instrument. Bruce Haynes lists him among the great oboists of the baroque period.Unfortunately, no compositions by Jacobi have survived.\nPassage 9:\nJohann Gottlieb Kugelann\nJohann Gottlieb Kugelann (2 January 1753 – 8 September 1815) was a German entomologist.

Before that, Selander was assistant director on films such as The Cat and the Fiddle (1934), A Night at the Opera (1935), and Fritz Lang\'s Fury (1936).\nTo this day Selander remains one of the most prolific directors of feature Westerns in cinema history, having taken the helm for 107 Westerns between his first directorial feature in 1936 and 1967.  In 1956 he was nominated for the Directors Guild of America award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Television, for his work directing a 1954 episode of Lassie.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 5:\nFolgore Division\nFolgore Division (Italian: Divisione Folgore) is a 1955 Italian war film directed by Duilio Coletti. It is based on actual events and depicts the 185th Airborne Division Folgore during the battle of El-Alamein. The screenwriter and military advisor was Marcantonio Bragadin.\n\nPlot\nIn the summer of 1942, during the Second World War, a group of young paratroopers from the Folgore Division, after having undergone a long and tiring training in Italy, was transported by air to the Libyan desert to cover the Italian-German front. The young soldiers believe that their destination is the island of Malta (operation C3) or the area of Alexandria: instead they find themselves thrown into a desert region where they are forced to live in holes dug in the sand and to face with insufficient means the armored British armored units. They will sadly see their parachutes piled up inside a warehouse in the desert. Thus develops that epic fight, which takes the name of the battle of El-Alamein, in which a handful of heroic fighters try with every effort to stop or at least delay the advance of General Montgomery\'s British tanks. Once their line-up has broken through, the survivors resist for several days an unequal struggle against the preponderant English forces, even being mentioned, for their heroism, by the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who called them ""The lions of the Thunderbolt"".\n\nCast\nEttore Manni: The Captain\nFausto Tozzi: The Sergeant\nJosé Jaspe: Salvi\nMarco Guglielmi: Lt.

The best known member is kudzu, also called Japanese arrowroot. The genus is named after 19th century Swiss botanist Marc Nicolas Puerari.\nThe genus, as traditionally circumscribed, is polyphyletic, with different species being more related to other species in the tribe Phaseoleae. Current research, reproduced below, splits the genus into five clades, one of which defines the current monophyletic genus.\n\nSpecies\nThe genus Pueraria is highly polyphyletic; the below list is divided by clade following the result of A.N.Egan & B.Pan (2016).

It grows in semi-arid areas with rainfall of between 150mm and 300mm, in the Karoo of South Africa.\n\nEtymology\nThe species epithet nelii honours the South African botanist Gert Cornelius Nel. The common name ""split rock"" refers to the appearance of the plant\'s leaves.\n\nDescription\nPleiospilos nelii is a succulent perennial which can reach a height of 5–8 cm (2–3 in) and a diameter of about 10 cm (4 in). This very short-stemmed, nearly stemless plant has one or more pairs of opposite, almost hemispherical, grey-green or brownish leaves. The surface of the leaves has many small dark spots. A new pair of leaves is produced each year, replacing an older pair. This plant closely resembles a small cracked rock (hence the common name), an appearance which may have evolved as a defence against herbivory. The superficially daisy-like flowers are yellow-orange, 6–7.5 cm (2–3 in) across, and emerge from the plant\'s apical bud. The flowers are large in relation to the size of the plant. Each flower opens in the afternoon and closes at sunset, over a bloom period of several days.\n\nCultivation\nP. nelii is one of several plants cultivated for their rocklike appearance. They are sometimes collectively called mesembs. In temperate regions it is grown under glass for protection from excessive rain and hard freezes. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society\'s Award of Garden Merit.\n\nGallery\nPassage 3:\nPleiospilos simulans\nPleiospilos simulans (liver plant, split rock plant) is a species of flowering plant in the family Aizoaceae, once endemic to the Eastern Cape of South Africa. Known populations of the plant in the wild are now extinct due its collection as an ornamental plant for succulent collectors. It is a small, low-growing, perennial with succulent leaves and orange or yellow many-petaled flowers.\nPassage 4:\nPleiospilos\nPleiospilos is a genus of succulent flowering plants of the family Aizoaceae, native to South Africa. The name is derived from the Greek pleios ""many"" and spìlos ""spot"". The plants are also known as kwaggavy (""Quagga mesemb""), lewerplant (""liver plant""), lewervygie (""liver mesemb""), klipplant (""stone plant""), split rock or mimicry plant.\nPleiospilos species have two or four opposite, very fleshy, grey-green leaves growing from a short stem that may be underground. The leaves, with their hemispherical shape and pitted texture, often strongly resemble a pile of split pebbles to deter predators. Flowers emerge from the center of the leaves, and may be very big in relation to the overall size of the plant.They reproduce both sexually and asexually. Vegetative offshoots emerge from the root system. Seed set occurs in early spring around March.The species P. bolusii and  P. nelii are cultivated as ornamentals.\n\nSpecies\nPleiospilos bolusii\nPleiospilos compactus\nP. compactus subsp. compactus\nP. compactus subsp. canus\nP. compactus subsp. minor\nP. compactus subsp. fergusoniae\nP. compactus subsp. sororius\nPleiospilos nelii\nPleiospilos simulans\nPassage 5:\nPleiospilos bolusii\nPleiospilos bolusii, the mimicry plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aizoaceae, native to the Eastern Cape of South Africa, where it grows at an altitude of 750–1,100 m (2,461–3,609 ft). The species epithet bolusii honours Harry Bolus, a 19th-century South African botanist.\nIt is a small, stemless succulent perennial growing to 8 cm (3 in) tall by 15 cm (6 in) wide, with two or four opposite grey-green leaves, quite thick, fused at the base, almost triangular, with entire margins. The leaves are longer and more angular than those of the closely related P. nelii, but in both cases the shape and texture of the leaves resemble a pile of split pebbles, possibly to deter predators. The yellow, many-petaled, daisy-like flowers emerge from the center of the leaves, and are 6–8 cm (2–3 in) in diameter - large in relation to the overall size of the plant. The flowers are often coconut-scented. The flowering period extends from August to September.\nThe plant is one of several species cultivated for their rocklike appearance, which are sometimes collectively called mesembs. With a minimum temperature of 7 °C (45 °F), in temperate regions it is grown under glass. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society\'s Award of Garden Merit.\n```\n\nQuestion: Which is a flowering plant, Pueraria or Pleiospilos?\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 2541, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 2541, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 8}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

As of 2020 census, Dazhou was home to 5,385,422 inhabitants whom 1,850,869 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of 2 urban districts.\n\nHistory\nDazhou\'s history goes back to the Eastern Han Dynasty when in 90 AD it was made a county by the name of Liweizhou (历为州). Then until the Liao Dynasty its name was Zaidi (在地). During the Liao and Tang dynasties its name was again changed, this time to Tongzhou (通州). Finally in the Song Dynasty it was given its present name of Dazhou.\nNotable people from Dazhou include the Three Kingdoms writer Chen Shou, Song Dynasty astronomer Zhang Sixun, and Ming and Qing Dynasty philosopher and educator Tang Zhen. Dazhou also made notable contributions to the Communist Revolution. Red Army heroes such as Xu Xiangqian, Li Xiannian, Xu Shiyou, Wang Weizhou (王维舟), and Zhang Aiping were all from or lived in Dazhou.\nThe partially preserved mausoleum complex (in particular, its gate towers, known as que of the Shen (沈) family in Qu County,\ndating from the Han Dynasty, is a well-known  architectural monument.\n\nGeography and climate\nDazhou is the easternmost prefecture-level division of the province, bordering Ankang and Hanzhong (both in Shaanxi) to the north, Chengkou County, Kai County, and Wanzhou District of Chongqing to the east, the Chongqing counties of Liangping and Dianjiang to the south, Guang\'an to the southwest, Nanchong to the west, and Bazhong to the northwest. It is centrally located between Chongqing and Xi\'an. The area is 16,600 square kilometres (6,400 sq mi).\nThe terrain is largely mountainous (Daba Mountains and adjacent ranges).\nTypical of the Sichuan Basin, Dazhou has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa) and is largely mild and humid, with four distinct seasons. Winter is short, mild, and foggy, though actual precipitation is low. January averages 6.1 °C (43.0 °F) and, while frost may occur, snow is rare. Summers are long, hot and humid, with highs often exceeding 33 °C (91 °F). The monthly daily average in July, the warmest month, is 27.4 °C (81.3 °F). Rainfall is light in winter and can be heavy in summer, and over 70% of the annual total occurs from May to September. The annual frost-free period lasts around 300 days.\n\nAdministration\nIt is one of Sichuan\'s most populous cities with 5,468,097 residents as of 2010 census.\n\nEconomy\nDazhou is an important river and land transportation hub for the region. Numerous national highways, expressways, and rail lines pass through Dazhou connecting it directly with major cities in China such as Chengdu, Xi\'an, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Beijing, etc., making it one of Sichuan\'s important trade centers.\nDazhou has numerous natural resources including large natural gas fields and an abundance of mineral resources such as salt, coal, manganese, lithium, and limestone. Major agricultural products include pork, beef, and tea. Other industries are chemical production, coal power, metallurgy, textiles, building materials, and processed food.\n\nTourism\nDazhou is blessed with both cultural and natural attractions. There are several national and provincial cultural sites and many national and provincial protected forests and nature reserves. Xuanhan\'s Baili Gorges have scenery and rapids, leading to the nickname ""Little Three Gorges"".

Located on the Jiangsu North Plain with a coastline of 112 km (70 mi), Dafeng was historically one of the largest salt-making areas in China and now is famed for its well preserved eco-system and numerous national conservation parks. The district has the largest national nature reserve for a rare deer species, Père David\'s Deer or Milu (麋鹿) in Chinese. It borders the prefecture-level city of Taizhou to the southwest.\nThe district nicknamed ""the enclave of Shanghai"" was a major destination for the sent-down youth from the city. Part of the county was put under Shanghai to establish a municipal farm since 1950, and there are still several farms and two prisons administered by Shanghai at present.\n\nHistory\nZhang Jian established Ts\'ao-yen-ch\'ang Ta-feng Salt&Cultivation Limited Company (Chinese: 草堰場大豐鹽墾股份有限公司; pinyin: Cǎoyànchǎng Dàfēng Yánkěn Gǔfèn Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī) in 1917, at Caoyan, a town of Dafeng nowadays. The northern Dongtai under the CPC became a separate county in 1942. The county was designated Taipei (臺北) for its location (north [pei] of Dongtai [abbreviated to tai]). Considering its namesake in Taiwan, it was renamed Dafeng, derived from Zhang\'s company in 1951.\n\nGeography, resources, and climate\nDafeng borders four counties including Dongtai, Sheyang, Yancheng and Xinghua. The county has a coastline of 112 km (70 mi) and a magnificent size of the wetland along its coastline, which is around near 800,000 hectares, sheltering enormous numbers of species of insects, fish, wild animals, and millions of migrating birds.\nUpon the completion of Sutong Bridge, the district will significantly reduce the driving time to two hours to Shanghai and the south of Jiangsu.\nDafeng has a warm and wet subtropical climate and is influenced by the East Asian monsoon. It has distinct seasons and an abundant sunshine. The average annual temperature is close to 15 °C and the normal precipitation is over 1,000 mm yearly.\n\nTransport\nYancheng Dafeng railway station\n\nAdministrative divisions\nIn the present, Dafeng District has 10 towns.\n10 towns\n```\n\nQuestion: Are both Dafeng District and Dazhou located in the same province?\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 2686, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 2686, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 8}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

It was first described in 1856 as Bromelia blanda. As of November 2022, the Encyclopaedia of Bromeliads listed it under the synonym Quesnelia strobilospica, which it spelt Quesnelia strobilispica.\nPassage 2:\nHoneysuckle\nHoneysuckles are arching shrubs or twining vines in the genus Lonicera () of the family Caprifoliaceae, native to northern latitudes in North America and Eurasia. Approximately 180 species of honeysuckle have been identified in both continents. Widely known species include Lonicera periclymenum (common honeysuckle or woodbine), Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle, white honeysuckle, or Chinese honeysuckle) and Lonicera sempervirens (coral honeysuckle, trumpet honeysuckle, or woodbine honeysuckle). L. japonica is a highly invasive species considered a significant pest in parts of North America, Europe, South America, Australia, and Africa.Some species are highly fragrant and colorful, so are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. In North America, hummingbirds are attracted to the flowers, especially L. sempervirens and L. ciliosa (orange honeysuckle). Honeysuckle derives its name from the edible sweet nectar obtainable from its tubular flowers. The name Lonicera stems from Adam Lonicer, a Renaissance botanist.\n\nDescription\nMost species of Lonicera are hardy twining climbers, with a minority of shrubby habit. Some species (including Lonicera hildebrandiana from the Himalayan foothills and L. etrusca from the Mediterranean) are tender and can only be grown outside in subtropical zones. The leaves are opposite, simple oval, 1–10 cm (0.39–3.94 in) long; most are deciduous but some are evergreen.\nMany of the species have sweetly scented, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that produce a sweet, edible nectar, and most flowers are borne in clusters of two (leading to the common name of ""twinberry"" for certain North American species). Both shrubby and vining sorts have strongly fibrous stems which have been used for binding and textiles.\nThe fruit is a red, blue or black spherical or elongated berry containing several seeds; in most species the berries are mildly poisonous, but in a few (notably Lonicera caerulea) they are edible and grown for home use and commerce. Most honeysuckle berries are attractive to wildlife, which has led to species such as L. japonica and L. maackii spreading invasively outside of their home ranges. Many species of Lonicera are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species—see a list of Lepidoptera that feed on honeysuckles.\n\nInvasive species\nThe spread of L. japonica in North America began in the United States in 1806, and it was widely cultivated by the 1860s. It was first discovered in Canada in Ontario forests in 1976, and became invasive by 2007. L. japonica was introduced in Australia between 1820 and 1840.Several species of honeysuckle have become invasive when introduced outside their native range, particularly in North America, Europe, South America, Australia, and Africa.  Invasive species include L. japonica, L. maackii, L. morrowii, L. tatarica, and the hybrid between the last two, L. × bella.\n\nCultivation\nHoneysuckles are valued as garden plants, for their ability to cover unsightly walls and outbuildings, their profuse tubular flowers in early summer, and the intense fragrance of many varieties. The hardy climbing types need their roots in shade, and their flowering tops in sunlight or very light shade. Varieties need to be chosen with care, as they can become substantial. Cultivars of the dense, small-leaved L. nitida are used as low, narrow hedges.The following hybrids have gained the Royal Horticultural Society\'s Award of Garden Merit:\n\nOther cultivars are dealt with under their species names.\nThe honeysuckle species L. japonica is grown as a commercial crop for traditional Chinese medicine use.\n\nPhytochemicals and sensory effects\nHoneysuckle is renowned for its colorful, fragrant flowers and variously colored fruit, indicating the presence of complex phytochemicals underlying these properties. Component analyses of berries from 27 different cultivars and 3 genotypes of edible honeysuckle (Lonicera caerulea var. kamtschatica) showed the presence of iridoids, anthocyanins, flavonols, flavanonols, flavones, flavan-3-ols, and phenolic acids. While sugars determine the level of sweetness in the berries, organic acids and polyphenols are responsible for the sour taste and tartness. Some 51 of the same compounds in berries are found in flowers, although the proportions of these compounds varied among cultivars studied.\n\nInteraction with other species\nMany insects in the order Lepidoptera visit honeysuckles as a food source. An example of this is the moth Deilephila elpenor. This nocturnal species of moth is especially attracted to honeysuckles, and they visit the flowers at night to feed on their nectar.\n\nSelected species\nSome 180 species of Lonicera are documented.\nSeveral fossil species are known from the Miocene of Asia.\nPassage 3:\nQuesnelia dubia\nQuesnelia dubia is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae, endemic to Brazil (the state of Bahia).

It has a well-formed rosette of about 20 plain green leaves.  These leaves have lightly serrated edges and are tipped by a sharp spine.  The bloom reaches about a foot high. The inflorescence bears rosy red bracts and violet or white petals. It is a semi-cold hardy bromeliad that can tolerate temperatures down to 25 °F for a few hours.\n\nCultivars\nQuesnelia \'Farro\'\n× Quesmea \'Lymanii\'\nPassage 10:\nLonicera caprifolium\nLonicera caprifolium, the Italian woodbine, perfoliate honeysuckle, goat-leaf honeysuckle, Italian honeysuckle, or perfoliate woodbine, is a species of perennial flowering plants in the genus Lonicera of the family Caprifoliaceae. It is native to parts of Europe, and naturalised in South East Britain and northeastern North America.  It can readily be distinguished from Europe\'s most common species, Lonicera periclymenum, by its topmost leaves, which are perfoliate as the Latin name suggests (that is, the stem appears to grow through the centre of the leaf). It is a vigorous, deciduous climber growing up to 8 metres.  It bears masses of very fragrant, cream-coloured flowers, tinged with pink, appearing in midsummer.\n```\n\nQuestion: Which genus has more species, Quesnelia or Honeysuckle?\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 2500, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 2500, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 8}]",5,0.375,20127,4025.4,282.18,430,86.0,6.03,8,0.07,4,39.5755706922002,ml.g5.48xlarge,llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705773235,meta-textgeneration-llama-2-70b-2024-01-20-17-53-55-754,763104351884.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference:2.0.1-tgi1.1.0-gpu-py39-cu118-ubuntu20.04,s3://jumpstart-private-cache-prod-us-east-1/meta-textgeneration/meta-textgeneration-llama-2-70b/artifacts/inference-prepack/v1.0.0/,3600,/opt/ml/model,4095,4096,/opt/ml/model,1,1,inference.py,8,,,,

Infestation by Botrytis requires moist conditions. If the weather stays wet, the damaging form, ""grey rot,"" can destroy crops of grapes. Grapes typically become infected with Botrytis when they are ripe. If they are then exposed to drier conditions and become partially raisined this form of infection brought about by the partial drying process is known as noble rot. Grapes when picked at a certain point during infestation can produce particularly fine and concentrated sweet wine. Some of the finest Botrytized wines are picked berry by berry in successive tries (French for ""selections"").\n\nOrigins\n\nAccording to Hungarian legend the first aszú (a wine using botrytised grapes) was made by Laczkó Máté Szepsi in 1630. However, mention of wine made from botrytised grapes had already appeared in the Nomenklatura of Fabricius Balázs Sziksai, which was completed in 1576. A recently discovered inventory of aszú predates this reference by five years. When vineyard classification began in 1730 in the Tokaj region, one of the gradings given to the various terroirs centered on their potential to develop Botrytis cinerea.\n\nA popular myth is that the practice originated independently in Germany in 1775, where the Riesling producers at Schloss Johannisberg (Geisenheim, in the Rheingau region) traditionally awaited the say-so of the estate owner, Heinrich von Bibra, Bishop of Fulda, before cutting their grapes. In this year (so the legend goes), the abbey messenger was robbed en route to delivering the order to harvest and the cutting was delayed for three weeks, time enough for the Botrytis to take hold. The grapes were presumed worthless and given to local peasants,  who produced a surprisingly good, sweet wine which subsequently became known as Spätlese, or late harvest wine. In the following few years, several different classes of increasing must weight were introduced, and the original Spätlese was further elaborated, first into Auslese in 1787  and later Eiswein in 1858 (although Eiswein is usually made from grapes not affected by Botrytis). \n\nViticulture and uses\n\nInternationally renowned botrytised wines include the aszú of Tokaj-Hegyalja in Hungary and Slovakia (commonly called Tokaji, Tokajské or Tokay), Sauternes from France - where the process is known as pourriture or pourriture noble, and Beerenauslese or Trockenbeerenauslese wines from Germany and Austria. Other wines of this type include the Romanian Grasă de Cotnari, French Coteaux du Layon, French Monbazillac, Austrian Ausbruch and South African Noble Late Harvest (NLH). Depending on conditions the grapes may be only minimally botrytized. Botrytis has also been imported for use by winemakers in California and Australia. In some cases inoculation occurs when spores are sprayed over the grapes, while some vineyards depend on natural inoculation from spores present in the environment.\nQuestion:\nNoble Rot is a fungus affecting which fruit?\nAnswer:\nWhite Grape\nPassage:\nRide of the Valkyries\nThe ""Ride of the Valkyries"" () is the popular term for the beginning of act 3 of Die Walküre, the second of the four operas by Richard Wagner that constitute Der Ring des Nibelungen.\n\nAs a separate piece, the ""Ride"" is often heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes. Together with the ""Bridal Chorus"" from Lohengrin, the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" is one of Wagner\'s best-known pieces.\n\nContext \n\nIn the Walküre opera, the ""Ride"", which takes around eight minutes, begins in the prelude to the third act, building up successive layers of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal a mountain peak where four of the eight Valkyrie sisters of Brünnhilde have gathered in preparation for the transportation of fallen heroes to Valhalla. As they are joined by the other four, the familiar tune is carried by the orchestra, while, above it, the Valkyries greet each other and sing their battle-cry. Apart from the song of the Rhinemaidens in Das Rheingold, it is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner\'s Ring cycle.\n\nPerformance history \n\nThe complete opera Die Walküre was first performed on 26 June 1870 in the National Theatre Munich against the composer\'s intent. By January of the next year, Wagner was receiving requests for the ""Ride"" to be performed separately, but wrote that such a performance should be considered ""an utter indiscretion"" and forbade ""any such thing"".  However, the piece was still printed and sold in Leipzig, and Wagner subsequently wrote a complaint to the publisher Schott.  In the period up to the first performance of the complete Ring cycle, Wagner continued to receive requests for separate performances, his second wife Cosima noting ""Unsavoury letters arrive for R. – requests for the Ride of the Valkyries and I don\'t know what else.""  Once the Ring had been given in Bayreuth in 1876, Wagner lifted the embargo. He himself conducted it in London on 12 May 1877, repeating it as an encore. \n\nOutside opera \n\nIn film \n\nUses in film include the original score for The Birth of a Nation (1915),  and What\'s Opera, Doc? (1957). \n\nThe ""Ride"" is also associated with Apocalypse Now (1979),  where the 1/9 Air Cavalry regiment plays the piece of music on helicopter-mounted loudspeakers during their assault on a Vietnamese village as psychological warfare and to motivate their own troops. \n\nIn military \n\nThe ""Ride"" is the regimental quick march of the British Parachute Regiment. \n\nIn music \n\nWithin the concert repertoire, the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" remains a popular encore, especially when other Wagnerian extracts feature in the scheduled program. For example, at the BBC Proms it was performed as such by Klaus Tennstedt and the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 6 August 1992  and also by Valery Gergiev with the Kirov Orchestra on 28 August 2001. \n\nDiscography \n\nApart from where the ""Ride"" is included in the recordings of the Walküre opera, it is a very popular piece, included in various popular classics anthologies. For instance in Deutsche Grammophon\'s 1991 Classicmania two CD album (von Karajan version), and in Brilliant Classics\' 2011 Best Film Classics CD box, there included in the fifth CD, Opera at the Movies, with a reference to Apocalypse Now on the sleeve.\nQuestion:\n""Who composed """"Ride of the Valkyries""""?""\nAnswer:\nWagner\'s\nPassage:\n35th Anniversary - Thirty-Fifth Wedding Anniversary\n35th Anniversary - Thirty-Fifth Wedding Anniversary\nMost Popular Song 35 Years Ago: ""PHYSICAL"" - Olivia Newton John\nPrice of Gasoline when you were married: $1.22 / gallon\nTRADITIONAL GIFT:  According to ancient  history, coral is said to have a magical power to prevent sterility. Coral is  mostly comprised of calcium carbonate. Coral has an opaque quality to it and  can be found in pink, white, orange, red and black. Angel-skin coral is  considered one of the most valuable of all coral. It is found near Japan and  used in most fine coral jewelry. The most valuable coral is called blood coral.  Found near Italy, blood coral is the most expensive coral in the world. Any  coral that contains parts of blood coral is immediately more valuable. Red  coral defends against plague and pestilence. It is thought that uncut coral  worn around the neck will lose its color if that person is in the presence of  another person who is going to die.\nMODERN GIFT:  Jade is another gift associated with the 35th anniversary and is  emerald green in color. The two minerals that mostly comprise jade are jadeite  and nephrite. Jadeite is the more sought after and valuable of the  two. The best jadeite is found in Myanmar in Asia. Jade can also be found in  yellow, pink, purple and black. The most common color is emerald green. In  ancient times it was thought that jade protected the kidney, liver, spleen,  heart, larynx, thymus and thyroid. Jade was associated with increased body  strength and advanced longevity.\nGEMSTONE:  The emerald is known for  its brilliant green shine. This shine comes from a high content of chromium.  Genuine emeralds contain trace amounts of iron, which actually increases the  value of the stone. Some of the best emeralds in the world are found in South  America, particularly Columbia and Brazil. Ancient Egyptians buried emeralds  with mummies. Some of the oldest emeralds in the world were harvested from the  infamous “Cleopatra mines”. Emeralds are known to be very tough gems, but they  are prone to cracks on the surface, which could devalue the gem. For this  reason, before the gems are sold to the public, they are treated with epoxy or  oils to fix or prevent any cracks and improve the transparency.\nWe hope that you have  enjoyed reading this historical information about the 35th wedding anniversary.

She has climbed Mount Fuji in Japan as well as the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps, among others. By 1972, Tabei was a recognized mountain climber in Japan.\n\nEverest expedition\n\nThe team of JWEE (Japanese Women’s Everest Expedition) consisted of fifteen, mostly working women including teachers, a computer programmer and a juvenile counselor. Two of them, including Tabei, were mothers.  JWEE, headed by Eiko Hisano, was a part of the Ladies Climbing Club, founded in 1969. After successful summit of Annapurna III on May 19, 1970 by Tabei and Hiroko Hirakawa,  LCC decided to attack Mount Everest.\n\nAlthough they obtained last-minute funding from Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper and Nippon Television, all the members still had to pay an amount that was almost equal to Japan’s average salary. To save money, they would use recycled car sheets to sew up water-proof pouches and over-gloves. They purchased goose feather from China and made their own sleeping bags. Students at school collected unused packets of jam for their teachers. \n\nAfter a long training period, they began the expedition early in 1975 when they traveled to Kathmandu. They used the same route Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay took in 1953.\n\nIn early May the women were camping at 6,300 meters when an avalanche struck their camp. The women, including Tabei and the guides, were buried under the snow. Tabei lost consciousness for approximately six minutes until her Sherpa guide dug her out. Twelve days after the avalanche, Tabei became the first female to reach the summit of Mount Everest.\n\nLater activities\n\nOn 28 June 1992 Tabei finished the climb of Puncak Jaya to become the first woman to complete the Seven Summits. \n\nTabei had a goal to climb the highest peak in every country in the world and continues to work on ecological concerns. Tabei is the director of Himalayan Adventure Trust of Japan, an organization working on a global level to preserve mountain environments.\nQuestion:\nIn 1975, Junko Tabei became the first woman to reach the summit of which mountain?\nAnswer:\nMt.

Fielding never admitted to writing the work, but it is widely considered to be his.  It is a direct attack on the then-popular novel Pamela (1740) by Fielding\'s contemporary and rival Samuel Richardson and is composed, like Pamela, in epistolary form.\n\nPublishing history\n\nShamela was originally published anonymously on 4 April 1741 and sold for one shilling and sixpence. A second edition came out on 3 November that same year which was partly reimpressed and partly reset where emendations were made.\n\nA pirated edition was printed in Dublin in 1741 as well. Reprint editions have subsequently appeared as texts for academic study.\n\nPlot summary\n\nShamela is written as a shocking revelation of the true events which took place in the life of Pamela Andrews, the main heroine of Pamela. From Shamela we learn that, instead of being a kind, humble and chaste servant-girl, Pamela (whose true name turns out to be Shamela) is in fact a wicked and lascivious creature and former prostitute, scheming to entrap her master, Squire Booby, into marriage.\n\nThemes and style\n\nThe novel is a sustained parody of, and direct response to, the stylistic failings and moral hypocrisy that Fielding saw in Richardson\'s Pamela. Reading Shamela amounts to re-reading Pamela through a deforming magnifying glass; Richardson\'s text is rewritten in a way that reveals its hidden implications, to subvert and desecrate it.  \n\nRichardson\'s epistolary tale of a resolute servant girl, armed only with her \'virtue\' to battle against her master\'s attempts at seduction, had become an overnight literary sensation in 1741. The implicit moral message – that a girl\'s chastity has eventual value as a commodity – as well as the awkwardness of the epistolary form in dealing with ongoing events, and the triviality of the detail which the form necessitates, were some of the main targets of Fielding\'s travesty.\n\nRecent criticism has explored the ways in which Pamela in fact dramatises its own weaknesses. From this perspective, Fielding\'s work may be seen as a development of possibilities already encoded in Richardson\'s work, rather than a simple attack.

In 1920, the average water level was about 26 meters (85 feet) below sea level. By 1977, the water level had dropped by about 3 meters (10 feet). Then, it rose over the next two decades flooding infrastructure, causing large amounts of economic damage, and forcing tens of thousands of people to move. Then in the mid-1990s, the Caspian Sea began dropping again. The water level now stands at about 27 meters below sea level.\nWith global climate change looming in the coming decades, researchers are attempting to understand all the factors that control the water level on the Caspian. Key factors include: how much rain falls; how much water gets diverted into reservoirs for human use; how much water evaporates before reaching the lake; how do tectonic activity and oil extraction change the height of the land.\nNew research suggests that dust storms may have an effect as well. A study by scientists from the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics and from Istanbul Technical University details how airborne dust affects the region’s climate and water cycle in several ways. For instance, dust particles absorb sunlight, so a cloud of dust can change the distribution of heat in the atmosphere. Specifically, dust clouds warm the atmosphere and cool the water surface below. Such changes reduce the amount of evaporation at the water surface, make the atmosphere less turbulent, and reduce convection (heat rising in the atmosphere). Together, these changes reduce the likelihood of rain.\nThe researchers concluded that dust storms over the Caspian Sea likely reduce lake surface temperatures by 1 to 2 degrees Celsius (1.8  to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), while increasing evaporation by about 0.5 millimeters (0.02 inches) per day. This can lead to a drop in lake levels equivalent to 10 millimeters (0.4 inches) per year. In their model, the researchers used observations of dust collected by several satellites sensors, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites, the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), and the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWIFS).\nOn June 6, 2016, the MODIS instrument on NASA’s Aqua satellite captured this image of a thick layer of dust over the southern Caspian Sea.  Notice how the dust has almost completely obscured the water. The dust particles absorb heat from the Sun rather than allowing it to heat the water surface. Dust storms like this are common over the Caspian in spring and summer.\nReferences\nQuestion:\nWhat body of water is 86 feet (26 meters) below sea level?\nAnswer:\nApsheron Threshold\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nThe Ten Commandments (1956) on iTunes\nThe Ten Commandments (1956) on iTunes\nOpen iTunes to preview, buy, and download this movie.\nAbout the Movie\nBased on the Holy Scriptures, with additional dialogue by several other hands, The Ten Commandments was the last film directed by Cecil B. DeMille. The story relates the life of Moses, from the time he was discovered in the bullrushes as an infant by the pharoah\'s daughter, to his long, hard struggle to free the Hebrews from their slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. Moses (Charlton Heston) starts out ""in solid"" as Pharoah\'s adopted son (and a whiz at designing pyramids, dispensing such construction-site advice as ""Blood makes poor mortar""), but when he discovers his true Hebrew heritage, he attempts to make life easier for his people. Banished by his jealous half-brother Rameses (Yul Brynner), Moses returns fully bearded to Pharoah\'s court, warning that he\'s had a message from God and that the Egyptians had better free the Hebrews post-haste if they know what\'s good for them. Only after the Deadly Plagues have decimated Egypt does Rameses give in. As the Hebrews reach the Red Sea, they discover that Rameses has gone back on his word and plans to have them all killed. But Moses rescues his people with a little Divine legerdemain by parting the Seas. Later, Moses is again confronted by God on Mt. Sinai, who delivers unto him the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile, the Hebrews, led by the duplicitous Dathan (Edward G. Robinson), are forgetting their religion and behaving like libertines. ""Where\'s your Moses now?"" brays Dathan in the manner of a Lower East Side gangster. He soon finds out. A remake of his 1923 silent film, DeMille\'s The Ten Commandments may not be the most subtle and sophisticated entertainment ever concocted, but it tells its story with a clarity and vitality that few Biblical scholars have ever been able to duplicate. It is very likely the most eventful 219 minutes ever recorded to film\x97and who\'s to say that Nefertiri (Anne Baxter) didn\'t make speeches like, ""Oh, Moses, Moses, you splendid, stubborn, adorable fool""?\nCredits\nAverage Rating: 7.5/10\nTop Critics\' Reviews\nFresh: DeMille remains conventional with the motion picture as an art form.

It is first sung in the musical by the character Alex Dillingham, which was originated by Michael Ball in both the London and Broadway casts.  The song was released as a single in 1989, also sung by Ball,  and stayed in the UK singles chart for 14 weeks, peaking at #2 and becoming Ball\'s signature tune.  The song was later featured on Ball\'s 1992 self titled debut album and Love Changes Everything: The Collection.   \n\nIn the prologue to Aspects of Love, a young Englishman, Alex, is lovestruck by a French actress, Rose. This upends his world, and he sings that ""Love changes everything ... How you live and / How you die"" for better or for worse.  He notes that love ""Makes fools of everyone"" and concludes that, once love strikes, ""Nothing in the / World will ever / Be the same.""  Musically, it is a ""simple, effective three-chord piano-accompanied anthem"".  The song became the best-known number from Aspects of Love and it ""delivered yet more proof that Andrew Lloyd Webber could deliver soaring, anthemic ballads"".  \n\nThe song was featured at the 44th Tony Awards.  Artists who have covered it include Jonathan Antoine, John Barrowman, Sarah Brightman, Michael Crawford, Il Divo (with Michael Ball), Audra McDonald, Nana Mouskouri, Marti Webb, Opportunity Knocks winner Mark Rattray, Anthony Warlow, and Hayley Westenra.  The Off-Broadway spoof revue Forbidden Broadway picked up on the bed-hopping aspect of Aspects of Love, changing the song to ""We Sleep with Everyone"". \n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nFrom which show does Love Changes Everything come from?\nAnswer:\nAspects Of Love\nPassage:\nSmallest Island Nation | Dimensions Info\nSmallest Island Nation | Dimensions Info\nSmallest Island Nation\nThe smallest island nation is Nauru (official title is Republic of Nauru). The total area is 21 square kilometers (8.1 sq mi). The December 2 to 6 census puts the population at 9,275. The 2009 estimate is 14,019. The density is 476.2/km2. The island can be found at the South Pacific.\nGeneral Information\nNauru is the tiniest independent republic on the planet. It also holds the distinction of being the only republic that doesn’t have a capital. Based on archaeological findings, the island was first inhabited by Polynesians and Micronesians over 3,000 years ago. A dozen tribes were on the island. This can be seen by the 12 points on its flag.\nEarly History\nThe smallest island nation in the world had its first European visitor in 1798. It was a whaler named Captain John Fearn. Other Europeans would get wind of it. European criminals and deserters would often escape to the island.\nThe local inhabitants began trading food for firearms. This practice would lead to a tribal war. The Nauruan Tribal War lasted for ten years. It devastated the island and reduced the population by 1/3.\nThe 1800s and World War I\nThe war ended in 1888 when the nation fell under German rule. The war ended when the Germans forbade firearms and alcohol. The island nation became part of the German Marshall Islands Protectorate. Christian missionaries began arriving that year as well.\nThe Germans lost Nauru to the UK during World War I. The island nation would become part of the UK, Australia and New Zealand. These countries took control of the phosphate mining in Nauru.\nWorld War II and Independence\nThe country fell to the Japanese in World War II. Over a thousand native inhabitants were sent to the Chuuk Islands for slave work. It was liberated by the Allies in 1945.\nThe UN designated administrative rights to the UK, New Zealand and Australia. Nauru was granted independence in 1966. Operation and ownership of the phosphate deposits were given to the country.\nPopulation\nIndigenous peoples make up most of the country’s population. 58% are native to the island while 26% are Pacific Islanders. Europeans and some Chinese constitute the remaining eight percent. The dominant religion is Christianity.\nThe smallest island nation also has numerous minority religions. The most prominent is Baha\'i. The per capita income is $2,500 (2006 estimates). It still doesn’t have a capital, but Yaren is the seat of government. It is also the most populated area.\nFollow Us!\nQuestion:\nAt 21 square kilometers, which is the world\'s smallest island nation?\nAnswer:\nList of islands of Nauru\nPassage:\nQuality control\nQuality control, or QC for short, is a process by which entities review the quality of all factors involved in production. ISO 9000 defines quality control as ""A part of quality management focused on fulfilling quality requirements"". \n\nThis approach places an emphasis on three aspects:\n# Elements such as controls, job management, defined and well managed processes,   performance and integrity criteria, and identification of records\n# Competence, such as knowledge, skills, experience, and qualifications\n# Soft elements, such as personnel, integrity, confidence, organizational culture, motivation, team spirit, and quality relationships.\n\nControls include product inspection, where every product is examined visually, and often using a stereo microscope for fine detail before the product is sold into the external market. Inspectors will be provided with lists and descriptions of unacceptable product defects such as cracks or surface blemishes for example.\n\nThe quality of the outputs is at risk if any of these three aspects is deficient in any way.\n\nQuality control emphasizes testing of products to uncover defects and reporting to management who make the decision to allow or deny product release, whereas quality assurance attempts to improve and stabilize production (and associated processes) to avoid, or at least minimize, issues which led to the defect(s) in the first place. For contract work, particularly work awarded by government agencies, quality control issues are among the top reasons for not renewing a contract. \n\nNotable approaches to quality control\n\nThere is a tendency for individual consultants and organizations to name their own unique approaches to quality control—a few of these have ended up in widespread use:\n\nQuality control in project management\n\nIn project management, quality control requires the project manager and/or the project team to inspect the accomplished work to ensure its alignment with the project scope.  In practice, projects typically have a dedicated quality control team which focuses on this area.\nQuestion:\nWhat does T.Q.C. mean in manufacturing industry ?\nAnswer:\nQuality Standards\nPassage:\nJerry Kasenetz\nJerry Kasenetz (born May 5, 1943, Brooklyn, New York) is an American bubblegum pop producer who worked with Jeff Katz, the two working together as the Super K Productions company,  to manufacture and produce bands such as Shadows of Knight, Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus, The Music Explosion, 1910 Fruitgum Company, Crazy Elephant, and The Ohio Express.\nQuestion:\nThe name of what genre has its origin in what producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz had in their mouths when they discussed music targeting the younger crowd?\nAnswer:\nBubblegum Pop/Bubblegum Rock\nPassage:\nKielder Water\nKielder Water   is a large artificial reservoir in Northumberland in North East England.  It is the largest artificial lake in the United Kingdom by capacity and it is surrounded by Kielder Forest, the largest man-made woodland in Europe. The scheme was planned in the late 1960s to satisfy an expected rise in demand for water to support a booming UK industrial economy. But the decline of traditional heavy industry, together with more water-efficient industrial processes and better control of water supply leakage, served to undermine the original justification for the reservoir and many came to criticise the government-funded project as a white elephant. \n\nKielder Water is owned by Northumbrian Water, and holds 200 billion litres (44 billion gallons, or 0.2 cubic km), making it the largest reservoir in the UK by capacity (Rutland Water is the largest by surface area).  It has a  shoreline, and is 39.7 km (24.6 miles) from the sea. \n\nConstruction\n\nAfter the scheme was approved by Parliament in 1974, work to build the reservoir and the dam in the Kielder Valley began in 1975. The reservoir and dam was designed for Northumbrian Water by consulting engineers Babtie, Shaw and Morton.     with Sir Frederick Gibberd and Partners as consulting architect.  Earth moving and infrastructure construction was undertaken in a joint venture with AMEC and Balfour Beatty. \n\nThe design meant the loss of numerous farms and a school. The former permanent way of the Border Counties Railway was also taken away through the development of the reservoir.\n\nWork was completed in 1981. Elizabeth II officially opened the project the following year. The valley took a further two years to fill with water completely.\n\nHydro electric plant\n\nKielder Water is also the site of England\'s largest hydro electric plant. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 26 May 1982 and is owned by Northumbrian Water. In December 2005, RWE Npower Renewables bought the rights to operate the plant and sell the electricity generated by it, with a contract lasting until 2025. Following the takeover, the turbines were refurbished in 2005–2006, which increased the efficiency of the electricity generation. Controls were also updated, meaning that the plant can be operated from Dolgarrog in Wales.\n\nThe plant generates electricity using dual turbines which produce 6 megawatts (MW) of electricity. This comes from a combination of a 5.5\xa0MW Kaplan turbine, which generates electricity when water release takes place, and a 500 kilowatt (kW) Francis turbine that generates constantly from the compensation flow of water from the reservoir into the North Tyne. This gives the reservoir an average production of 20,000\xa0MWh of electricity per year, a saving of 8,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year compared to fossil fuel based methods of generation.\n\nOperations\n\nThe reservoir\'s main use is to provide compensating discharges into the North Tyne to support abstractions of water further downstream. It also underpins the £167m Kielder Transfer Scheme, where water can be transferred to the Wear and the Tees rivers, to meet shortfalls in those areas. In recent years, Kielder Water has become increasingly important, with underground springs ensuring that it always remains at high levels, regardless of the prevailing climate condition. This means that while the south of England is often forced to implement drought strategies and hosepipe bans, north east England enjoys plentiful water supplies.\n\nThere are two main visitor centres at Kielder Water—Leaplish waterside park and Tower Knowe visitor centre—and other facilities at Kielder, Falstone and Stannersburn villages. It is also one of the region\'s major tourist venues, attracting more than 250,000 visitors a year who come to enjoy the wide range of leisure opportunities on offer.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\n=\nQuestion:\nKielder Water is the largest artificial lake in the UK.

He then studied at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where Friedrich Walchner\'s lectures first stimulated his interest in chemistry. Next he attended the school of commerce in Leipzig, where he studied chemistry under Otto Linné Erdmann, who further developed his interest into a passion for questions of speculative chemistry.\n\nReturning home in 1834, he entered his father’s white lead factory, but soon found that business was not to his liking, and after a sharp disagreement with his father in his 20th year he enlisted in a cavalry regiment. In a few months military life became equally distasteful, and he purchased his discharge with the assistance of the German chemist Justus von Liebig. After a short period of living in Dresden, he went to the University of Giessen in central Germany in 1836 to study and work in Liebig\'s laboratory. His stay at Giessen lasted 18 months, and in 1837 he re-entered the factory. Again, however, he quarrelled with his father, and in 1838 he went to Paris with introductions from Liebig.\n\nIn Paris, he attended Jean Baptiste Dumas’ lectures and worked with Auguste Cahours (1813–1891) on essential oils, especially cumin, in Michel Eugène Chevreul’s laboratory at the Jardin des Plantes, meanwhile earning a precarious living by teaching and making translations of some of Liebig’s writings. In 1841, through the influence of Dumas, he was charged with the duties of chemistry professor at the Montpellier faculty of sciences, becoming titular professor in 1844.\n\nIn 1842 he annoyed his friends in Paris by the matter and manner of a paper on the classification of organic compounds. Later, he published Précis de chimie organique (1844–1845). In 1845 he and his opinions were the subject of an attack by Liebig, unjustifiable in its personalities but not altogether surprising in view of his wayward disregard of his patron’s advice. The two were reconciled in 1850, but his faculty for disagreeing with his friends did not make it easier for him to get another appointment after resigning the chair at Montpellier in 1851, especially as he was unwilling to go into the provinces.\n\nHe obtained leave of absence from Montpellier in 1848 so that he could pursue without interruption his special investigations, and from that year until 1855 he resided in Paris. During that period he established an École de chimie pratique (""School for practical chemistry"") for which he had great hopes. However, these hopes were disappointed, and in 1855, after refusing the offer of a chair of chemistry at the new Zürich Polytechnic in 1854, he accepted the professorships of chemistry at the Faculty of Sciences and the École Polytechnique at Strassburg, where he died the following year, having just completed checking the proofs for Traité de chimie organique (4 vols., Paris, 1853–56), his magnum opus. This latter work embodies all his ideas and his discoveries.\n\nWork\n\nGerhardt is known for his work on reforming the notation for chemical formulas (1843–1846). He also worked on acid anhydrides, and synthesized acetylsalicylic acid, albeit in an unstable and impure form.\n\nGerhardt is usually linked with his contemporary, Auguste Laurent, with whom he shared a strong and influential interest in chemical combination.\n\nDeath\n\nHe died on August 19, 1856, two days short of his birthday, after being poisoned by his own chemicals during laboratory work. He was 39 years old.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\n""in 1853 while working on the synthesis and properties of various acid anhydrides, French chemist Charles Frederic Gerhardt made acetylsalicylic acid by mixing acetyl chloride with a sodium salt of salicylic acid (sodium salicylate).

It is best known as the location of Claude Monet\'s garden and home.\n\nLocation\n\nGiverny sits on the ""right bank"" of the River Seine where the river Epte meets the Seine. The village lies 80 km from Paris, west and slightly north, in the old province of Normandy (it is officially in the département of Eure, in the région of Haute-Normandie).\n\nHistory\n\nA settlement has existed in Giverny since neolithic times and a monument uncovered attests to this fact. Archeological finds have included bootees dating from Gallo-Roman times and to the earlier 1st and 2nd centuries AD. The town was known in ancient deeds as ""Warnacum"". The cultivation of grapes has been an occupation of the inhabitants of Giverny since Merovingian times. The village church dates from the Middle Ages and is built partially in the Romanesque style, though additions have since been made. It is dedicated to Sainte-Radegonde. The village has remained a small rural setting with a modest population (numbering around 301 in 1883 when Monet discovered it) and has since seen a boom in tourism since the restoration of Monet\'s house and gardens.\n\nMonet at Giverny\n\nClaude Monet noticed the village of Giverny while looking out of a train window. He made up his mind to move there and rented a house and the area surrounding it. In 1890 he had enough money to buy the house and land outright and set out to create the magnificent gardens he wanted to paint. Some of his most famous paintings were of his garden in Giverny, famous for its rectangular Clos normand, with archways of climbing plants entwined around colored shrubs, and the water garden, formed by a tributary to the Epte, with the Japanese bridge, the pond with the water lilies, the wisterias and the azaleas.\n\nMonet lived in the house with its famous pink crushed brick façade from 1883 until his death in 1926. He and many members of his family are interred in the village cemetery.\n\nThe Giverny Colony \n \n\nBeginning around 1887, a number of American Impressionist artists settled to work in Giverny, drawn by the landscapes, the overall atmosphere, and the presence of Monet. These included Willard Metcalf, Louis Ritter, Theodore Wendel, and John Leslie Breck.  Soon many American extended their visits from summer through the entire year.  American painter Theodore Earl Butler married Monet\'s stepdaughter and sometime-model Suzanne Hoschedé there in 1892.  \n\nFrederick Carl Frieseke spent every summer from 1906 through 1919 in a residence next door to Monet\'s.  The term Decorative Impressionism was coined in 1911 to describe Frieseke\'s work, and the term describes the work of a ""second wave"" of American painters in Giverny such as Richard E. Miller.  In December 1910, six of the Giverny artists (Frieseke, Miller, Lawton S. Parker, Guy Rose, Edmund Greacen and Karl Anderson) were given a show at the Madison Gallery in New York which termed them ""The Giverny Group.""  \n\nWorld War I largely marked the end of the art colony.\n\nAttractions\n\nClaude Monet\'s property at Giverny (house and gardens), left by his son to the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1966, became a Museum opened to public visit in 1980 after completion of large-scale restoration work: the huge Nymphea\'s studio was restored and the precious collection of Japanese engravings was displayed in several rooms, hung in the manner chosen by the master himself; the gardens were replanted as they once were.  The house became a popular tourist attraction (the Claude Monet Foundation), particularly in the summer when the flowers are in bloom.\n\nThe other main attraction of the village is the Museum of Impressionism Giverny dedicated to the history of impressionism and its continuation in the Giverny art colony and along the valley of the river Seine.\n\nThe Hôtel Baudy was a center of artistic life in the Giverny heyday. It is now still a café and restaurant, with period decoration.\n\nPopulation\nQuestion:\nWhich French painter famously designed a garden at his home in Giverny, in which he created many of his most famous paintings?\nAnswer:\nClaude-Oscar Monet\nPassage:\nGustav Klimt, The Kiss | Art History: Symbolism | Khan Academy\nGustav Klimt, The Kiss (video) | Khan Academy\nGustav Klimt, The Kiss\nPractice: Symbolism and Art Nouveau\nVideo transcript\n[MUSIC PLAYING] DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: We\'re in the Belvedere in Vienna, and we\'re looking at Gustav Klimt\'s The Kiss from 1908. Probably the most famous Klimt, and actually, I have to admit that I had forgotten that the painting was almost a perfect square, because I\'ve seen in so many posters where it\'s been cut down and made into a rectangle. DR: BETH HARRIS: It\'s a very large painting and there\'s so much gold that it\'s hard not to think of a religious icon. And I think in some ways Klimt was trying to create a modern icon-- something that suggested a sense of transcendence. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Well there\'s no question that the gold here makes you think of the Byzantine tradition, maybe some of the tile work at Ravenna. There is a way that the patterning, especially around the faces, becomes a kind of halo, as well. You have Klimt building up the gold. He\'s got those gold circles, they actually rise off the surface of the canvas. DR: BETH HARRIS: And catch the light, much the way that the gold was tooled in medieval paintings. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: There is this sense of the male figure of patterns that are direct of linear in contrast to the curvilinear to the circles and the ovals that we seen in the female form. But the point that you made about the sense of the spiritual is so powerful in this painting. I think we forget that that darker gold ground seems so much as if the figures are somehow being dissipated into the cosmos, that there are so lost in the intensity, the eternity of that kiss. DR: BETH HARRIS: And all removed from the everyday world. I mean, we have to remember that this is a time of incredible modernization in Vienna. The city of Vienna has been transformed in the previous 30 years into a modern city. Here Klimt is abstracting a universal experience from the trauma, the difficulties, the anxieties of everyday life. I think it\'s also important to see this in relationship to Klimt\'s Beethoven Frieze, where the figures confront evil forces-- these mythic figures-- and in the end, there\'s this embrace, this kiss, this emergence from evil into fulfillment and perfection. A minute ago, we were looking at the painting by Egon Schiele called The Embrace, but there there was so much more of a sense of the physicality, of the body\'s. The way that the bodies really aren\'t present here and are cloaked in these decorative forms, reminds us how much Klimt, although he was exploring this kind of sensuality, was also disguising it, or covering it with a kind of decorative patterning. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And that\'s absolutely right, with the exception of the faces. And here, this is where the entire painting changes. The female figure is completely full frontal but horizontal. So that there\'s this beautiful sense of here passivity receiving that kiss, but also a kind of deep interior feeling with her eyes closed. Her fingers just delicately touching his as he holds her head and his neck reaches out and round, and you get a sense of his physical power through the strength of that neck, but also the intensity of his desire. And of course, they\'re both crowned. As on his head you can see a wreath of leaves, on hers almost as if they were the stars of the heavens. DR: BETH HARRIS: Schiele gives us an image of a couple that\'s electrified by kind of agitated outlines. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Schiele is showing us a kind of truth through the energy of the moment. Whereas Klimt seems to be reaching out to a truth that is for all time, that is so aestheticized it feels as if it has a degree of absolute permanence.

Numerous species are distributed throughout the temperate and tropical oceans of the world, where they generally inhabit shallow water and coral reefs, and the genus is widely known for its planktonic (free-floating) species. While most species within the class Phaeophyceae are predominantly cold water organisms that benefit from nutrients upwelling, genus Sargassum appears to be an exception to this general rule.  Any number of the normally benthic species may take on a planktonic, often pelagic existence after being removed from reefs during rough weather; however, two species (S. natans and S. fluitans) have become holopelagic—reproducing vegetatively and never attaching to the seafloor during their lifecycle. The Atlantic Ocean\'s Sargasso Sea was named after the algae, as it hosts a large amount of sargassum. \n\nHistory\n\nSargassum was named by the Portuguese sailors who found it in the Sargasso Sea after a species of rock rose (Helianthemum) that grew in their water wells at home and that was called sargaço in Portuguese. \n\nThe Florida Keys and its smaller islands are well known for their high levels of Sargassum covering their shores. Gulfweed was observed by Columbus. Although it was formerly thought to cover the entirety of the Sargasso Sea, making navigation impossible, it has since been found to occur only in drifts. \n\nSargassum is also cultivated and cleaned for use as an herbal remedy. Many Chinese herbalists prescribe powdered Sargassum, either the species S. pallidum, or more rarely, hijiki, S. fusiforme, in doses of 0.5 gram, to be dissolved in warm water and drunk as a tea. It is called ""hai zao"" in Traditional Chinese Medicine, where it is used to resolve ""heat phlegm."" \n\nDescription \n\nSpecies of this genus of algae may grow to a length of several metres. They are generally brown or dark green in color and consist of a holdfast, a stipe, and a frond. Oogonia and antheridia occur in conceptacles embedded in receptacles on special branches.  Some species have berrylike gas-filled bladders which help keep the fronds afloat to promote photosynthesis. Many have a rough sticky texture, which together with a robust but flexible body, helps it to withstand strong water currents.\n\nEcology \n\nThe thick masses of Sargassum provide an environment for a distinctive and specialised group of marine animals and plants, many of which are not found elsewhere.\n\nSargassum is commonly found in the beach drift near Sargassum beds where they are also known as gulfweed, a term also used to include all seaweed species washed up on shore.\n\nSargassum species are found throughout tropical areas of the world and are often the most obvious macrophyte in near-shore areas where Sargassum beds often occur near coral reefs. The plants grow subtidally and attach to coral, rocks or shells in moderately exposed or sheltered rocky or pebble areas. These tropical populations often undergo seasonal cycles of growth and decay in concert with seasonal changes in sea temperature.   In some cases (e.g., the Sargasso Sea) there are floating populations of Sargassum.\n\nIn tropical Sargassum species that are often preferentially consumed by herbivorous fishes and echinoids, there is a relatively low level of phenolics and tannins. \n\nSargassum muticum\n\nSargassum muticum is a large brown seaweed of the class Phaeophyceae.  It grows attached to rocks by a perennial holdfast up to 5\xa0cm in diameter. From this holdfast the main axis grows to a maximum  of 5\xa0cm high. The leaf-like laminae and primary lateral branches grow from this stipe. In warm waters it can grow to 12 m long, however in British waters it gives rise to a single main axis with secondary and tertiary branches which are shed annually. Numerous small 2–6\xa0mm stalked air vesicles provide buoyancy. The reproductive receptacles are also stalked and develop in the axils of leafy laminae. It is self-fertile.\n\nDistribution\n\nSouth coast of England and several sites in the south of Ireland.\n\nSargassum adrift in Gulf Stream\n\n \n\nSargassum crisis in the Caribbean Sea\n\nIn the summer of 2015, large quantities of different species of Sargassum accumulated along the shores of many of the countries bathed by the Caribbean Sea. Some of the affected islands and regions include the Caribbean coast of Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Barbados and Tobago  The aquatic plant washes ashore, piles up on beaches, and decays, often causing a foul odor. The affected countries and territories are discussing causes of the outbreak, potential solutions, and the negative affects on tourism.  Researchers say that the Sargassum outbreak started in 2011, but it has become worse over the years. There are several factors that could explain the proliferation of Sargassum in the area in recent years. These include the rise of sea temperature and the change of sea currents due to climate change. Also, nutriments from agricultural fertilizers and wastewater from the cities, that end up in the sea, could also make the algae bloom.\nQuestion:\nSargassum is what type of plant?\nAnswer:\nMacroalgal\nPassage:\nGaribaldi (Paris Métro)\nGaribaldi  is a station on line 13 of the Paris Métro in the commune of Saint-Ouen.\n\nThe station opened on 30 June 1952 when the line was extended from Porte de Saint-Ouen to Carrefour Pleyel. It is named after Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882), Italian nationalist and leader of Italian unification.\n\nStation layout\nQuestion:\nA station on line 13 of the Paris Metro is named after which Italian nationalist (1807-1882)?\nAnswer:\nGaribaldi\nPassage:\nBéchamel sauce\nBéchamel sauce ( or;  ), also known as white sauce, is made from a white roux (butter and flour) and milk. Even though it first appeared in Italian cooking books (constituting one of the simplest sauces of the Italian cuisine), it is now considered one of the mother sauces of French cuisine.  It is used as the base for other sauces (such as Mornay sauce, which is Béchamel with cheese). \n\nOrigin\n\nBéchamel was a financier who held the honorary post of chief steward to King Louis XIV. The sauce first appeared in some Italian cooking books of the Rennaissance, but was introduced under its familiar name in Le Cuisinier François, published in 1651 by  François Pierre La Varenne (1615–1678), chef de cuisine to Nicolas Chalon du Blé, marquis d\'Uxelles. The foundation of French cuisine, the Cuisinier François ran through some thirty editions in seventy-five years.\n\nThe sauce originally was a veal velouté with a large amount of cream added. \n\nSaulnier\'s Répertoire presents one recipe as: ""White roux moistened with milk, salt, onion stuck with clove, cook for 20 minutes."" \n\nPreparation\n\nBéchamel is traditionally made by melting a quantity of butter, and adding an equal part of flour to make a roux, which is cooked under gentle heat while stirring with a whisk. As it is a white sauce, care must be taken not to brown the roux. Then heated milk is gradually whisked in, and the sauce is cooked until thickened and smooth. The proportion of roux and milk determines the thickness of the sauce, typically one to three tablespoons each of flour and butter per cup of milk. \n\nOne tablespoon each of butter and flour per cup of milk makes a thin, easily pourable sauce.  Two tablespoons of each makes a medium thick sauce. Three tablespoons of each makes an extra thick sauce, such as used to fill croquettes or as a soufflé base. Salt and white pepper are added and it is customary in Italy to add a pinch of nutmeg.  Optionally a whole or cut onion, studded with one or more whole cloves, and a bay leaf may be simmered with the milk and then strained before adding to the roux.\n\nUses\n\nSauces\n\nBéchamel sauce is the base for a number of other classic sauces with additional ingredients added including:\n*Mornay sauce (cheese)\n*Nantua sauce (crayfish, butter and cream)\n*Crème sauce (heavy cream)\n*Mustard sauce (prepared mustard seed)\n*Soubise sauce (finely diced onions that have been sweated in butter)\n*Cheddar cheese sauce (Cheddar cheese, dry mustard, Worcestershire sauce)\n\nThe term ""white sauce"" or sauce blanche may also be applied to a simple sauce consisting only of milk and melted butter, without flour or spices. \n\nDishes\n\nDishes made with béchamel sauce include:\n*Cauliflower cheese\n*Croque Monsieur (some variations)\n*Croquette\n*Fisherman\'s Pie\n*Lasagne\n*Parmo, a type of escalop originating in Middlesbrough, that is popular in North East England.\n*Moussaka and pastitsio, layered dishes found in Greece and throughout the Balkans and Middle East\n*Veal Orlov\nQuestion:\nWhat sort of sauce is created by combining Bechamel sauce with grated cheese?\nAnswer:\nMornaysauce\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nBargello museum Florence :: book now!\nBargello museum Florence :: book now!\nThe entrance of the Museum is on Via del Proconsolo n°4 - Florence.\nMuseum\nThe Museum displays the most important collection in the world of Renaissance Tuscan sculpture, with fundamental works by Donatello, Della Robbia, Verrocchio and Michelangelo, along with a significant group of medieval French ivories, Italian majolicas and arms.\nHistory\nThe museum is housed in the medieval Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo (or Bargello Palace), built starting from 1255 and enlarged in the 14th century, ancient residence of the Captain of the People, then of the Podestà and lastly of the Captain of Justice (called Bargello), that is the chief of the police (16th century), when the palace was transformed into a prison. The building was completely restored in order to house the Bargello National Museum, opened in 1865.\nCollections\nThe earlier museum was dedicated to Medieval applied arts: bronzes, majolicas, statues, coins, seals and medals. Donatello\'s year (1887-88) was the occasion to open the Hall of Renaissance Sculpture (today called ""of Donatello"") and between the late 19th century and the early 20th century, the collection was further enlarged thanks to private donations and legacies (Carrand, Ressmann, Franchetti), with new ivories, enamels, arms and armours.\nToday, on the ground floor of the museum, the Hall of the 16th century Sculpture displays important works by Michelangelo, Benvenuto Cellini, Jacopo Sansovino and Giambologna.\nOn the first floor, a balcony (""Verone""), adorned with bronze animals by Giambologna, leads to the vast Audience Hall, which houses many masterpieces by Donatello, his assistants and Luca Della Robbia, along with the famous bronze reliefs cast by Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi in competition for the second doors of the Florentine Baptistery.

The park is dedicated to California’s third capitol building, where the California State Legislature convened from February 3, 1853 to February 24, 1854, when they voted to move the state capital to Sacramento. It is the only pre-Sacramento capitol that remains. The park includes the Fischer-Hanlon House, an early Benicia building that was moved to the property and converted into a home in 1858, after the legislature departed. Benicia Capitol State Historic Park just off the city\'s main street also includes a carriage house, workers\' quarters and sculptured gardens.\n\nHistory\nFollowing large complaints by state legislators of inadequate furniture and sleeping quarters in Vallejo, California in early 1853, the Legislature, with the consent of Governor John Bigler, relocated the state capital to nearby Benicia that same year. The Legislature would convene in the Benicia City Hall for a little more than a year, when again complaints over poor weather conditions, inadequate and uncomfortable sleeping quarters, and ""the insecure condition of the public archives"" arose in January 1854.\nAfter a proposal by Sacramento to use the Sacramento County Courthouse free of charge as a capital building, the Assembly and Senate passed an enabling act, voiding all previous legislation, to move the state capital to its new location upriver in Sacramento. On February 25, 1854, Governor Bigler signed the act into law, moving the capital to its current location. The Legislature and governor climbed aboard the steamship Wilson G. Hunt to take up its new quarters. ""So much opposed to the removal were the good people of Benicia,"" the Sacramento Union reported, ""that the owners of the wharves, it is stated, refused to permit the steamer ... to land to take on the legislative furniture, unless she would pay $500."" This request was refused and the furniture was shipped from a different wharf.The Greek Revival-Palladian building was listed as a California State Historic Landmark on January 11, 1935. The National Register of Historic Places placed the Benicia capitol on the federal list on February 12, 1971.\n\nPresent day\nThe original building has been restored with reconstructed period furnishings and exhibits. The interior includes a reconstruction of the building\'s original floor with ponderosa pine. The desks, four of which are from the 1850s or earlier, are furnished with a candlestick, a 19th-century newspaper, a quill pen, blotting sand, a spitoon, and a top hat.\n\nThe historic park is located at 115 West G Street in Benicia, a city in the northern San Francisco Bay Area between San Pablo Bay and Suisun Bay.\nOn February 16, 2000, the California State Legislature met in the old Capitol in a symbolic session to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Legislature\'s first meeting.\n\nProposed for closure\nThe Benicia Capitol State Historic Park was one of the 48 California state parks proposed for closure in January 2008 by California\'s Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger as part of a deficit reduction program, since rescinded following public outcry. It also was placed on the Governor\'s list of two hundred parks to close in fall of 2009 in response to the ongoing budget crisis and was on Jerry Brown\'s 2011 list of 70 proposed state park closures in the continuing budget crises.In March 2013, then-Director of California Department of Parks and Recreation, Anthony L. Jackson, announced that no state parks would close during his tenure and that he had ""done away with park closures.""\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of California state parks\nCalifornia State Legislature\nJohn Bigler\nPassage 2:\nFruita Rural Historic District\nThe Fruita Rural Historic District is a historic district in the Capitol Reef National Park in Wayne County, Utah, United States, that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nDescription\nThe district comprises a former Mormon agricultural settlement that was active from 1895 to 1947.

Thompson, the retired editor of Life magazine, was asked by the then-Secretary of the Smithsonian, S. Dillon Ripley, to produce a magazine ""about things in which the Smithsonian [Institution] is interested, might be interested or ought to be interested.""Thompson would later recall that his philosophy for the new magazine was that it ""would stir curiosity in already receptive minds. It would deal with history as it is relevant to the present. It would present art, since true art is never dated, in the richest possible reproduction. It would peer into the future via coverage of social progress and of science and technology. Technical matters would be digested and made intelligible by skilled writers who would stimulate readers to reach upward while not turning them off with jargon. We would find the best writers and the best photographers—not unlike the best of the old Life.""In 1973, the magazine turned a profit for the first time. By 1974, circulation had nearly quadrupled, to 635,000, and it reached the one million milestone in 1975—one of the most successful launches of its time.

Rasenberger\'s article also featured an interview with Genovese\'s roommate, Mary Ann Zielonko, who revealed that she and Kitty had been lovers.Rasenberger\'s book The Brilliant Disaster about the Bay of Pigs Invasion during JFK\'s administration, was named by Kirkus Reviews as one of the best nonfiction books of 2011. The Miami Herald pointed out that while Rasenberger had a personal connection to the story—his father was a lawyer who aided the Kennedy brothers’ efforts to free the jailed Cuban rebels—“he is no apologist for the administration; he concedes the arrogance and incompetence that blinded the so-called best and brightest to the invasion plan’s glaring flaws.”Rasenberger is a graduate of Dartmouth College.\n\nPublications\nThe Brilliant Disaster: JFK, Castro, and America\'s Doomed Invasion of Cuba\'s Bay of Pigs  New York: Scribner, 2011.

He won the Australian Open Mixed Doubles with Samantha Stosur in 2005. Draper also reached the fourth round of the 1995 and 1996 French Opens, and the fourth round of the US Open in 1997. His most significant achievement in singles was winning the 1998 Queen\'s Club Championships, the lowest ranked player ever to do so.\n\nPersonal life\nDraper was born in Queensland, Australia. He married his first wife, Kellie, in 1998 and she died in 1999 from cystic fibrosis.\n\nTennis career\nJuniors\nDraper reached a high of No. 5 in the junior world doubles rankings in 1992, after winning the Wimbledon Boys\' Doubles title.\nJunior Slam results – Singles:\nAustralian Open: SF (1992)\nFrench Open: 1R (1992)\nWimbledon: 2R (1992)\nUS Open: –\n\nJunior Grand Slam finals\nDoubles: 1 (1 title)\nATP career finals\nSingles: 3 (1 title, 2 runners-up)\nDoubles: 1 (1 runner-up)\nMixed Doubles: 1 (1 title)\nATP Challenger and ITF Futures finals\nSingles: 5 (5–0)\nDoubles: 2 (1–1)\nPerformance timelines\nSingles\nDoubles\nMixed Doubles\nGolf career\nDraper has also played golf professionally. He made his professional debut in the 2005 Victorian Open, a 54-hole event played from 28 to 30 January. Draper had accepted an offer from Sam Stosur to play in the mixed doubles at the 2005 Australian Open which also finished on 30 January. Draper and Stosur reached the semi-final, which meant that Draper had to play in the first round of the golf in the morning and the semi-final of the tennis in the afternoon. Draper played his second round on the following day but missed the cut. This meant he was free to compete in the final of the mixed doubles on 30 January. On 11 February 2007, Draper won the New South Wales PGA Championship on the Von Nida Tour. He finished the four-round event with a score of 268, 20-under-par, one stroke ahead of Andrew Bonhomme and Aaron Townsend. Draper played as a professional golfer from 2005 to 2008 when a back injury ended his professional career. Although he played tennis left-handed, he played golf right-handed.\n\nProfessional wins (1)\nVon Nida Tour wins (1)\nPassage 2:\nPeter Curtis (tennis)\nPeter Curtis  (born 29 August 1945 ) is a former British professional tennis player.

Made by Hammer Films, it was adapted by Nigel Kneale from the 1960 novel The Devil\'s Own by Norah Lofts, published under the pseudonym Peter Curtis.\n\nPlot\nSchoolteacher Gwen Mayfield comes back to England after suffering a nervous breakdown caused by an attack by witch-doctors while working in a mission in Africa. She\'s hired by the wealthy Reverend Alan Bax, who runs a school in the remote village of Heddaby. Once there, Gwen finds out Alan is not actually a minister, and only wears a clerical collar out of ""a sense of security""; the only church in the village is in ruins. Meanwhile, she befriends Alan\'s sister, an esteemed journalist.\nThe romance between two of Gwen\'s students, Ronnie Dowsett and Linda Rigg, is sternly opposed by adults in the village for reasons Gwen can\'t understand. Linda lives with her grandmother, who\'s rumoured to be a witch and Ronnie fears is abusing Linda.\nAs Ronnie is a gifted student, Alan proposes to pay for his stay at a prep school outside the village, but the boy\'s father is against it. Gwen volunteers to tutor the boy.\nRonnie gives Linda a male doll as a mate to her female one, to represent them as a couple. The next day, Ronnie falls into a coma, and Gwen finds the male doll with pins stuck through it and its head missing. She shows it to Stephanie, who indicates someone might be dabbling in witchcraft. Impressed by Gwen\'s knowledge of magical practices in Africa, Stephanie invites her to coauthor an article about witchcraft in contemporary England.\nRonnie\'s superstitious mother becomes upset when Gwen asks her about Ronnie\'s state. Later, she goes to Granny Rigg\'s house to work out a deal. The next day, Ronnie is out of the coma and is quickly taken by his mother to stay with her relatives in Wales. Ronnie\'s father confronts Granny Rigg about it and is later found drowned in a nearby pond.\nGwen starts to think people who believe themselves to be witches are behind these incidents, and realizes that if they\'re trying to keep Ronnie apart from Linda, it could mean they might be planning to sacrifice her as a virgin. She announces her will to testify at the inquest into Ronnie\'s father\'s death. Following an injury caused by Stephanie\'s dogs, Gwen is taken to the Baxes\' home where she is treated by the local doctor. During the night, she gets frightened by the sudden appearance of an African totem, and suffers another nervous breakdown.\nMonths later, Gwen is recovering in a nursing home with no recollection of ever leaving Africa. After a visiting little girl\'s doll triggers the return of her memories, she escapes the hospital and hitchhikes back to Heddaby, where she\'s welcomed to stay at the Baxes\' again. One of the villagers whispers to her that Linda, officially in vacation at her cousin\'s, has actually been taken by the witches.\nOne night, Gwen sees from the Baxes\' window a group of people scurrying toward the ruined church, and goes to investigate, finding a witches\' coven led by Stephanie, who reveals she had planned to initiate Gwen into their ranks. Stephanie explains that she has learned a ritual that extends life through the ritual sacrifice of a pure maiden, planned for the next night, in occasion of Lammastide. The place of sacrifice is to be kept spiritually clean or the power of the ritual will turn upon the witch. Unable to find where they are hiding Linda, Gwen waits for the ceremony. Linda is there but in a trance, unable to assist in her own rescue. As Stephanie raises the ritual knife to kill the girl, Gwen cuts herself and smears her blood on Stephanie\'s robe, defiling it. Seized with convulsions, Stephanie tries to remove her soiled garb, but falls dead.\nWeeks later, freed of Stephanie\'s influence, Heddaby has returned to normal. Gwen chooses to stay and work as a schoolteacher for Alan.\n\nCast\nProduction\nThe village of Hambleden, Buckinghamshire, was the filming location for the fictional village of Heddaby. Interiors were filmed at Hammer\'s usual studio at Bray in the same year that the famous horror film company vacated their home altogether for (mainly) Elstree and Pinewood. The cast featured child-actor Martin Stephens, then 17. The supporting cast also included Hammer regular Duncan Lamont, as well as John Collin, Michele Dotrice, Leonard Rossiter and Bryan Marshall. The score was by Richard Rodney Bennett.\n\nCritical reception\nVariety called the film ""routine entertainment"". The Hammer Story: The Authorised Biography of Hammer Films called the film ""unsettling, though compromised by a hysterical climax"", writing, ""when The Witches strikes the right balance it ultimately succeeds as an engrossing thriller, even if it ultimately disappoints as Hammer horror.""On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 67% of 9 critics\' reviews are positive.\nPassage 7:\n1999 Stella Artois Championships – Singles\nScott Draper was the defending champion but lost in the third round to Sargis Sargsian.\nPete Sampras won in the final 6–7(1–7), 6–4, 7–6(7–4) against Tim Henman.\nThis was the only year in which Roger Federer competed in this tournament.\n\nSeeds\nThe top eight seeds received a bye to the second round.\n\nDraw\nKey\nFinals\nTop half\nSection 1\nSection 2\nBottom half\nSection 3\nSection 4\nExternal links\n1999 Stella Artois Championships draw\nPassage 8:\n2005 Australian Open – Mixed Doubles\nSamantha Stosur and Scott Draper defeated Liezel Huber and Kevin Ullyett in the final 6–2, 2–6, [10–6] to win the mixed doubles title at the 2005 Australian Open.

The only Bond film that he did not work on during that period was Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), as he was working on Cameron\'s Titanic (1997) at the time.  He also worked extensively as a set dresser on the Carry On series in the 1960s.\nThroughout his near 60-year career, Lamont was nominated for four Academy Awards for his work on Fiddler on the Roof (1971), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Aliens (1986), and Titanic (1997), winning for the latter film.
