The album was originally meant to be entitled Kissing the Beehive; however, due to possible copyright infringements in relation to Jonathan Carroll's 1997 novel of the same name, this title was changed. Singer and keyboardist Spencer Krug said that the band \"didn't know that was the title of a book... We might have to change it, but we might not. And we'll have to make it clear that it's not [named] after his book. It's a complicated situation.\" It had also been reported earlier by Blender that the record was entitled Pardon My Blues; however, on April 28, Sub Pop officially announced that the album's name would be At Mount Zoomer.\n\nAlbum overview\nThe band started playing new songs live that would end up on At Mount Zoomer as early as summer 2007. Among the first to be played were \"Language City\" and \"Fine Young Cannibals\".\nAccording to singer and guitarist Dan Boeckner, half of the album was recorded in Farnham, Quebec at Petite \u00c9glise, an old church that was converted to a recording studio by the band Arcade Fire for the production of their album Neon Bible. After touring the east coast in late 2007, Wolf Parade recorded the rest of At Mount Zoomer at MIXart Studios in Montreal, Quebec. Afterwards, the album was mixed at Arlen Thompson's sound studio, Mount Zoomer.The cover art for the album features the work of Matt Moroz and Elizabeth Huey, depicting a battle scene between the two artists.The track \"Call It a Ritual\" was released by the band on April 14, 2008.\n\nReception\nAt Mount Zoomer received positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the album holds a score of 78 out of 100 based on 28 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nWolf Parade \u2013 mixing, producing, \"overdubs and vocals recorded by\"\nHarris Newman \u2013 mastering\nArlen Thompson \u2013 recording (tracks 1, 2, 4, 6-8), \"one vocal recorded by\"\nDavid Ferry \u2013 recording (tracks 3, 5, 9)\nNick Petrowski \u2013 recording (tracks 3, 5, 9)\nDavid Smith \u2013 \"some vocals recorded by\"\nJace Lasek \u2013 \"some vocals recorded by\"\nElizabeth Huey \u2013 artwork\nMatt Moroz \u2013 artwork\nPassage 5:\nTear Ourselves Away\nTear Ourselves Away is the first full-length LP by San Francisco-based indie rock band LoveLikeFire.

Blow in the Wind features several tracks which are led off with musical mash-ups of, or homages to, classic Punk songs, a trend the group began on their second album, Are a Drag (with an appropriation of \"Generator\" by Bad Religion for their cover of \"My Favorite Things\") and would continue with Take a Break and Ruin Jonny's Bar Mitzvah: \"Sloop John B\" samples \"Teenage Lobotomy\" by The Ramones, \"Elenor\" samples \"London Calling\" by The Clash, \"San Francisco\" samples \"Stranger Than Fiction\" by Bad Religion, \"I Only Want to Be With You\" samples and \"The Money Will Roll Right In\" by Fang. Similarly, the track \"Different Drum\" also ends with a guitar riff taken from \"Georgy Girl\" by the Seekers.\nThe first song begins with a clip similar to the hidden track on the NOFX album Punk in Drublic where Fat Mike attempts to find the proper pitch of the word \"how\" in the line \"How did the cat get so fat?\" from \"Perfect Government\".\nThe album is made up entirely of \"Hits of the 1960s\". The band's version of \"Different Drum\" can be heard during the credits of the film Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.\nThe band's version of \"Sloop John B\" is featured in the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nSpike Slawson - vocals\nChris Shiflett (a.k.a.

It introduced the band's style of fast, abrasive punk rock with tongue-in-cheek humor and sarcastic lyrics. The album was originally released as an LP but was repackaged the following year as a CD including tracks from the band's first 2 EPs Puke and Balls, as well as the previously unreleased tracks \"Malted Vomit\" and \"Ghost.\" It was re-released again in 1996 by Nitro Records under the title The Album Formerly Known as Full Length LP.\nThe album proved to be a success for the band, expanding their fan base and giving them opportunities to play shows all over southern California alongside other popular punk rock bands. An animated music video was made for the song \u201c1, 2, 3\u2026Slam!\u201d and played on local punk rock and skateboarding video programs.

The river flows generally north by northeast through the Eungella National Park and is joined by thirteen minor tributaries, towards its mouth and empties into the Coral Sea north of Bowen. With a catchment area of 1,200 square kilometres (460 sq mi), the river descends 253 metres (830 ft) over its 60-kilometre (37 mi) course.High salinity levels have been recorded at the mouth of the river. Land use in the upper catchment is mostly beef cattle production with crops grown in the richer soils downstream.The river is crossed by the Bruce Highway via the Don River Bridge at Bowen.\n\nFlooding\nThe highest recorded flood was in 1970 when the river reached 7.25 metres (23.8 ft) at the Bowen Pumping Station. The river delta is particularly vulnerable to flooding during cyclones.Floods in 2008 left deposits of sand which raised the riverbed considerably. Approval to dredge sand was granted by the Queensland Government, however only about half of that has been removed in recent years. A flood in 2008 lead the Whitsunday Regional Council to create a channel so that similar flooding could be avoided.A management plan for the river was established late in 2008.  It included measures to encourage further sand extraction.\n\nSee also\n\nList of rivers of Australia \u00a7 Queensland\nPassage 2:\nBowen River (Queensland)\nThe Bowen River is a river in North Queensland, Australia.\n\nCourse and features\nFormed by the confluence of the Broken River and the Little Bowen River near Tent Hill in the Normanby Range, part of the Great Dividing Range, the Bowen River flows in a north-westerly direction along the base of the range then flows west across Emu Plains and is crossed by the Bowen Developmental Road just north of Havilah. The river then flows north-west again between the Herbert Range and Leichhardt Range then discharges into the Burdekin River, south southeast of Ravenswood. The river descends 98 metres (322 ft) over its 129-kilometre (80 mi) course.The catchment area of the river occupies 9,452 square kilometres (3,649 sq mi) of which an area of 236 square kilometres (91 sq mi) is composed of riverine wetlands. The catchment is in poor condition with much of the riparian habitat having been cleared and prone to erosion. The area is mostly used for cattle grazing with the towns of Collinsville and Glendon both drawing their town water supply from the Bowen River Weir. The river has a mean annual discharge of 1,618 gigalitres (3.56\u00d71011 imp gal; 4.27\u00d71011 US gal).The Bowen River Weir supplies water to a coal mine, power station and the township of Collinsville.\n\nHistory\nThe river was named in 1861 by the Queensland Government, derived from the name of the town Bowen which was named in honour of Sir George Bowen, a  Governor of Queensland.In the 1860s, Richard Daintree made mineral discoveries along the river. Daintree made the first systematic examination of the Bowen River coal seams near Collinsville.Circa 1865, the Bowen River Hotel was built at the top of a steep bank of the river (20.534\u00b0S 147.5562\u00b0E\ufeff / -20.534; 147.5562\ufeff (Bowen River Hotel)). The hotel is now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.Construction of the Bowen River Weir commenced in April 1982 and was completed in August 1983. The A$6.5 million project is situated approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) south of Collinsville and delivers water to the Newlands Coal Mine.\n\nSee also\nList of rivers of Australia \u00a7 Queensland\nPassage 3:\nAlder Creek (Siskiyou County, California)\nAlder Creek is a  river located in Siskiyou County, California.\nPassage 4:\nBighead River\nThe Bighead River is a river in Grey County in southern Ontario, Canada, that flows from the Niagara Escarpment between the communities along Ontario Highway 10 of Arnott and Holland Centre in the township of Chatsworth to empty into Nottawasaga Bay, an inlet of Georgian Bay on Lake Huron, at Meaford.\nThe river crosses the Bruce Trail in the valley between the Spey River Forest Area and the Walters Falls Conservation Area.\n\nTributaries\nEast Minniehill Creek (right)\nMinniehill Creek (right)\nRocklyn Creek (right)\nWalters Creek (right)\n\nSee also\nList of rivers of Ontario\nPassage 5:\nAibiki River\nThe Aibiki River (\u76f8\u5f15\u5ddd, Aibiki-gawa) is a river located in Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.\n\nName\nThe river is named \"Aibiki\" (roughly translating as \"mutual pulling\") because both its source and its mouth are in the Seto Inland Sea. During low tide, the river flows towards both the mouth and the origin, making it seem like it is being pulled both ways.\nIt is also said that the name came about during the Battle of Yashima, which was fought between the Minamoto and Taira clans.\nPassage 6:\nHaughton River\nThe Haughton River is a river in North Queensland, Australia.\n\nCourse and features\nThe headwaters of the river rise in the Haughton Valley of the Leichhardt Range near Mingela and flow in a north easterly direction almost immediately crossing the Flinders Highway. The river then passes between Mount Prince Charles and Mount Norman then past Glendale. Major Creek discharges into the Haughton under Major Creek Mountain and the river continues crossing the Bruce Highway just south of Giru. The Haughton enters Bowling Green Bay National Park and finally discharges into Bowling Green Bay south of Townsville near Cungulla and then into the Coral Sea.\nThe assessed catchment area of the river varies, with one estimate of the area at 8,690 square kilometres (3,360 sq mi) and another assessed at 4,051 square kilometres (1,564 sq mi). Of this latter area, 316 square kilometres (122 sq mi) is composed of estuarine wetlands.The floodplain area of the catchment also holds valuable wetlands, parts of the Bowling Green Bay National Park and Ramsar site (QDEH 1991) are listed in the Directory of Important Wetlands. The upper part of the catchment has few permanent waterholes. An estimated 77% of the catchment is cleared, cattle grazing is the dominant land use in the area, with the production of sugarcane and other forms of horticulture taking up most of the catchment area. An area of 328 square kilometres (127 sq mi) is protected.A total of 27 species of fish have been found in the river, including the glassfish, Pacific Short-finned Eel, blue catfish, milkfish, Fly-specked hardyhead, mouth almighty, Empire gudgeon, barred grunter, barramundi, oxeye herring, mangrove jack, eastern rainbowfish, Bony bream, Freshwater Longtom and Seven-spot Archerfish.\n\nEtymology\nThe river was named in 1861 after Richard Houghton, a stockman, by his friend the pastoralist and explorer James Cassady. Originally named Houghton River it was renamed to the current spelling by the Surveyor General in 1950 at the request of local residents and the electoral office.\n\nSee also\n\nList of rivers of Australia \u00a7 Queensland\nPassage 7:\nStuart River (Minnesota)\nThe Stuart River is a river located in Minnesota, in the United States.\n\nSee also\nList of rivers of Minnesota\nPassage 8:\nKakwa River\nThe Kakwa River is a tributary of the Smoky River in western Alberta, Canada.\nThe river is named for Kakwa, the Cree word for porcupine. Porcupines are abundant in Kakwa Provincial Park and Protected Area.\nTourism along the river revolves around bull trout fishing and white water rafting. Kakwa Falls (54.10913\u00b0N 119.92350\u00b0W\ufeff / 54.10913; -119.92350\ufeff (Kakwa Falls)) are developed in the course of the river, over a 30-metre (98 ft) high ledge formed by an outcrop of the Cadomin Formation. The area was designated a protected wildland (Kakwa Wildland Park). It can be accessed through the forestry road network south of Highway 666, approximately 35 kilometres (22 mi) south of Two Lakes Provincial Park.\n\nCourse\nThe Kakwa River originates in Kakwa Lake, north of McBride, in British Columbia, at an elevation of 1,495 metres (4,905 ft). The surrounding area is protected by Kakwa Provincial Park and Protected Area. The river flows north-east into the province of Alberta in Kakwa Wildlands Park, then flows east and north-east through the foothills. It is crossed by the Bighorn Highway before it converges into the Smoky River, at an elevation of 670 metres (2,200 ft).\n\nTributaries\nFrom its origins to its mouth, Kakwa River receives waters from:\n\nKakwa Lake\nCecilia Creek\nMouse Cache Creek\nMusreau Creek\nFrancis Peak Creek\nSouth Kakwa River\nLynx Creek\nRavine Creek\nChicken Creek\nDaniel Creek\nCopton Creek\nRedrock Creek\nRoute Creek\nPrairie Creek\n\nSee also\nList of rivers of Alberta\nPassage 9:\nDawson River (Queensland)\nThe Dawson River is a river in Central Queensland, Australia.\n\nCourse and features\nThe Dawson River rises in the Carnarvon Range, draining through the Carnarvon National Park, northwest of the settlement of Upper Dawson. The flows generally south by east, crossed by the Carnarvon Highway and then flows generally east through the settlement of Taroom where the river is crossed by the Leichhardt Highway. The river then flows in a northerly direction through the settlement of Theodore where the river is again crossed by the Leichhardt Highway. The river flows north through the settlement of Baralaba and towards Duaringa, crossed by the Capricorn Highway. A little further north, the Dawson River forms confluence with the Mackenzie River to form the Fitzroy River. From source to mouth, the river is joined by sixty-four tributaries, including the Don River, and descends 587 metres (1,926 ft) over its 735-kilometre (457 mi) course. Several weirs have been constructed along the river to provide water for cotton and dairy farming in the region. The river catchment covers an area of 50,800 square kilometres (19,600 sq mi).Expedition National Park and the Precipice National Park are protected areas along the Dawson River.\nThe Dawson River was one of a number of Queensland rivers affected by the 2010\u201311 Queensland floods. As the river inundated the town of Theodore it was completely evacuated, a first in Queensland's history.\n\nHistory\nGungabula (also known as Kongabula and Khungabula) is an Australian Aboriginal language of the headwaters of the Dawson River in Central Queensland. The language region includes areas within the local government area of Maranoa Region, particularly the towns of Charleville, Augathella and Blackall and as well as the Carnarvon Range.Ludwig Leichhardt explored the area in 1844 and named the river in honour of Robert Dawson, one of Leichhardt's financial backers.In the 1920s, shortly after the First World War, Australian Labor Party politician Ted Theodore (1884-1950) launched an irrigation program on the Dawson River for returning soldiers. His intentions was to provide them with arable land along the river for them to take up farming, thus eschewing a post-war recession. After the 1922 Irrigation Act was passed, he started irrigation schemes on the Dawson River, for an initial 8,000 new farmers. However, the scheme was abandoned after he realized the soil was unsuitable for farming and the returning soldiers had no agrarian skills.\n\nSee also\n\nBoggomoss\nList of rivers of Australia \u00a7 Queensland\nPassage 10:\nDee River (Queensland)\nThe Dee River is a river in Central Queensland, Australia.\n\nCourse and features\nPart of the Fitzroy River system, the Dee River rises in the Razorback Range south of Bouldercombe Gorge Resources Reserve near Mount Gavial, south of Bouldercombe. The river flows generally south by west through the mining settlement of Mount Morgan, Waluml and Dululu, where the river is crossed by the Burnett Highway. The river is joined by seven minor tributaries including Limestone Creek, Horse Creek, Hamilton Creek, Nine Mile Creek, Boulder Creek, Oaky Creek and Pruce Creek.  The Dee River forms its confluence with the Don River near Rannes.\nThe largest dam on the river is Number 7 Dam, built for the Mount Morgan Mine, which has a history of acid mine discharge from gold and copper mining entering the Dee River.\n\nMine pit\nIn January 2013, the mine pit overflowed. Approximately 700 millimetres (28 in) of rain fell after ex-tropical Cyclone Oswald resulted in the 2013 Eastern Australia floods.  Towards the end of February the dam was spilling acid and heavy metals into the river.  Concerns regarding the discolouration of the river's water and fears of contamination causing irreversible damage to the river were raised in mid-2011.\n\nSee also\n\nList of rivers of Australia \u00a7 Queensland\n```\n\nQuestion: Are Kakwa River and Bighead River located in the same country?\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
