The region holds significance as a region of historical importance, a major trading corridor, an economic and political powerhouse, and \nis currently geostrategic in that borders 5 nations major naval outlet to the Mediterranean Sea via two straits: Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, and Georgia.  The region also serves as a future connector of existing Turkish and European high speed rail networks.\n\nDefinition\n\nEast Thrace includes all in the eastern part of the historical region of Thrace. The area includes all the territories of the Turkish provinces of Edirne, Tekirda\u011f and K\u0131rklareli, as well as those territories on the European Continent of the provinces of \u00c7anakkale and Istanbul.\n\nClimate\n\nDue to the moderating effect of the surrounding seas, the climate tends to be Mediterranean in character.\n\nGeography \n\nEast Thrace has an area of 23,764\u00a0km2 (3 percent of the country) and a population of about 10 million people (about 12 percent of the total); the population density is around 430 people/km2, compared to about 80 people/km2 for Asiatic Turkey, which is also called Anatolia or Asia Minor.  However, densities are skewed by the metropolis of Istanbul.  The two are separated by the Dardanelles, the Bosphorus (collectively known as the Turkish Straits) and the Sea of Marmara, a route of about 361\u00a0km. The southernmost part of Eastern Thrace is called the Gallipoli peninsula. European Turkey is bordered on the west by Greece for 212\u00a0km and on the north by Bulgaria for 269\u00a0km, with the Aegean Sea to the south-west and the Black Sea to the north-east.  \n\n*** Disclaimer: Sources may modify and/or release updated data, this will not be automatically reflected in these tables, additionally the refugee crisis' vast floating migrants have seriously complicated data collection, especially since 2013.

A publication from December 21, 1912 in the Belgian magazine Ons Volk Ontwaakt (\u2018Our Nation Awakes\u2019) estimated 1,006,500 inhabitants in the vilayet:  \n*Muslim Turks - 250,000\n*Muslim Bulgarians - 115,000\n*Muslim Roma people - 15,000\n*Orthodox Armenians - 30,000\n*Orthodox Greeks - 220,000\n*Orthodox Bulgarians - 370,000\n*Orthodox Albanians - 3,500\n*Orthodox Turks - 3,000\nQuestion:\nEastern Thrace refers to which part of Turkey?\nAnswer:\nThe European (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nWhat is googol and googolplex? - Definition from WhatIs.com\nWhat is googol and googolplex? - Definition from WhatIs.com\npurchase intent\nA googol is 10 to the 100th power (which is 1 followed by 100 zeros). A googol is larger than the number of elementary particles in the universe, which amount to only 10 to the 80th power.\nThe term was invented by Milton Sirotta, the 9-year nephew of mathematician Edward Kasner, who had asked his nephew what he thought such a large number should be called. Such a number, Milton apparently replied after a short thought, could only be called something as silly as a \"googol.\"\nLater, another mathematician devised the term googolplex for 10 to the power of googol - that is, 1 followed by 10 to the power of 100 zeros. Frank Pilhofer has determined that, given Moore's Law (which is that computer processor power doubles about every 1 to 2 years), it would make no sense to try to print out a googolplex for another 524 years - since all earlier attempts to print a googolplex out would be overtaken by the faster processor.\nLarry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google , named their search engine after the term googol. In 1997, Larry was brainstorming names with other Stanford graduate students, including Sean Anderson, and looking at available domain name s. Anderson miskeyed googol as \"google\" and found it available. Larry liked it and the name \"Google\" stuck. Google's corporate headquarters is called the GooglePlex, an affectionately tongue-in-cheek reference to the origins of the company name.\nThis was last updated in December 2006\nContinue Reading About googol and googolplex\nQuestion:\nWhat name is given to number 1 followed by 100 zero's?\nAnswer:\nGoogolgon\nPassage:\nWind of the World: Brickfielder - Weather UK ...\nWind of the World: Brickfielder | weatheronline.co.uk\nLocation: Australia\nThe Brickfielder is a strong, hot, dry and dusty wind in southern Australia. The Brickfielder usually occurs during summer and is mainly affecting southeast Australia's states of Victoria and New South Wales . The Brickfielder is associated with the passage of a frontal zone of a low pressure. Preceding the passage of the front tropical, hot, dry north-westerly desert air from the interior of Australia is carrying clouds of dust and bringing sudden hot spells , often exceeding 38C (100F), to areas which normally have a much milder climate. The temperature might jump up 15 to 20 \u00b0C within hours.\nAfter the front has passed, temperatur es  will drop dramatically again and the now cold winds are veering to more south, south-westerly directions, originating from polar air masses and still blowing quite strong, often with gusts reaching gale force. The passing of the cold-front itself is often associated with violent thunderstorms even triggereing tornadoes. This wind now is called a Southerly Buster, the uneven brother of the Brickfielder.\nFor example, on January 14, 2001 temperatures in Sydney reached 34C (93F), with NE winds and dropped to 23C (73F) the very next day, veering to SE.\nThe hot northerly wind blew across the Brickfields, formerly so called, a district of Sydney and carried clouds of reddish dust from the brickworks over the nascent city - thus the name: Brickfielder. However, another - agricultural - explanation comes from the hot and dry character of the northerly wind itself, turning the surface of the already dry soil hard as bricks. Therefore, by confusion, every dry, hot wind from the north might be called a Brickfielder today. The Brickfielder is related to the Argentinian Zonda wind\nAdvertisement\nQuestion:\nIn Southern Australia, a strong, hot, dry dusty wind is known by what name?\nAnswer:\nBrickfielder\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nMatthew Webb\nCaptain Matthew Webb (19 January 1848 \u2013 24 July 1883) was the first recorded person to swim the English Channel without the use of artificial aids for sport purpose. On 25 August 1875, Webb swam from Dover to Calais in fewer than 22 hours.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nWebb was born at Dawley in Shropshire, one of twelve children of a Coalbrookdale doctor. He acquired his ability to swim in the River Severn at Coalbrookdale. In 1860 at the age of twelve he joined the training ship HMS Conway for two years then entered the merchant navy and served a three-year apprenticeship with Rathbone Brothers of Liverpool.\n\nWhilst serving as second mate on the Cunard Line ship Russia, travelling from New York to Liverpool, he attempted to rescue a man overboard by diving into the sea in the mid-Atlantic. The man was never found, but Webb's daring won him an award of \u00a3100 and the Stanhope Medal, and made him a hero of the British press.\n\nIn the summer of 1863, while at home, he rescued his 12-year-old brother Thomas from drowning in the Severn near Ironbridge.\n\nEnglish Channel swimming record\n\nIn 1873, Webb was serving as captain of the steamship Emerald when he read an account of the failed attempt by J. B. Johnson to swim the English Channel. He became inspired to try himself, and left his job to begin training, first at Lambeth Baths, then in the cold waters of the Thames, the English Channel and Hollingworth Lake. \n\nOn 12 August 1875, he made his first cross-Channel swimming attempt, but strong winds and poor sea conditions forced him to abandon the swim. On 24 August, he began a second swim by diving in from the Admiralty Pier at Dover. Backed by three escort boats and smeared in porpoise oil, he set off into the ebb tide at a steady breaststroke. Despite stings from jellyfish and strong currents off Cap Gris Nez which prevented him from reaching the shore for five hours, finally, after 21 hours and 45 minutes, he landed near Calais\u2014the first successful cross-channel swim. His zig-zag course across the Channel was over 39 miles (64\u00a0km) long.\n\nLater life\n\nAfter his record swim, Captain Webb basked in national and international adulation, and followed a career as a professional swimmer. He licensed his name for merchandising such as commemorative pottery, and wrote a book called The Art of Swimming. A brand of matches was named after him. He participated in exhibition swimming matches and stunts such as floating in a tank of water for 128 hours.\n\nOn 27 April 1880, he married Madeline Kate Chaddock, and they had two children, Matthew and Helen.\n\nDeath\n\nHis final stunt was to be a dangerous swim through the Whirlpool Rapids on the Niagara River below Niagara Falls, a feat many observers considered suicidal. Although Webb failed in an attempt at raising interest in funding the event,  on 24 July 1883, he jumped into the river from a small boat located near the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge and began his swim. Accounts of the time indicate that in all likelihood Webb successfully survived the first part of the swim, but died in the section of the river located near the entrance to the whirlpool.  Webb was interred in Oakwood Cemetery, Niagara Falls, New York. \n\nLegacy\n\nIn 1909, Webb's elder brother Thomas unveiled a memorial in Dawley. On it reads the short inscription: \"Nothing great is easy.\" The memorial was taken away for repair after a lorry collided with it in February 2009. The landmark memorial was returned after full restoration and was hoisted back onto its plinth in High Street in October 2009. A road (Webb Crescent) and Captain Webb School, both in Dawley, are named after the swimmer. A memorial plaque with his portrait was also unveiled in the parish church at Coalbrookdale. Webb House of the Adams' Grammar School in Newport, Shropshire, is named after Webb.\n\nCultural references\n\nJohn Betjeman's poem \"A Shropshire Lad\" (1940) commemorates the death of Captain Webb, portraying his ghost swimming back along the canal to Dawley.  It was set to music by Jim Parker and has been the most requested song on the repertoire of John Kirkpatrick during his entire career. \n\nCaptain Webb's picture on boxes of Bryant and May matches is said have inspired the physical appearance of the Inspector Clouseau character portrayed originally in the Pink Panther films by Peter Sellers. \n\nHe was parodied in Horrible Histories (TV Series) in stupid deaths.\nQuestion:\nMatthew Webb swam the English Channel and then drowned swimming where?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",

The Ramphastidae family is most closely related to the American barbets. They are brightly marked and have large often-colorful bills. The family includes five genera and about forty different species. The name of this bird group is derived from the Tupi word  tukana, via Portuguese.  The family includes toucans, aracaris and toucanets; more distant relatives include various families of barbets and woodpeckers in the suborder Pici.\n\nMorphology\n\nToucans range in size from the lettered aracari (Pteroglossus inscriptus), at 130 g (4.6\u00a0oz) and 29\u00a0cm (11.5\u00a0inches), to the toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), at 680 g (1.5\u00a0lb) and 63\u00a0cm (29\u00a0inches). Their bodies are short (of comparable size to a crow's) and compact. The tail is rounded and varies in length, from half the length to the whole length of the body. The neck is short and thick. The wings are small, as they are forest-dwelling birds who only need to travel short distances, and are often of about the same span as the bill-tip-to-tail-tip measurements of the bird.\n\nThe legs of the toucan are strong and rather short. Their toes are arranged in pairs with the first and fourth toes turned backward. The majority of toucans do not show any sexual dimorphism in their coloration, the genus Selenidera being the most notable exception to this rule (hence their common name, \"dichromatic toucanets\"). However, the bills of female toucans are usually shorter, deeper and sometimes straighter, giving more of a \"blocky\" impression compared to male bills. The feathers in the genus containing the largest toucans are generally black, with touches of white, yellow, and scarlet. The underparts of the ara\u00e7aris (smaller toucans) are yellow, crossed by one or more black or red bands. The toucanets have mostly green plumage with blue markings.\n\nThe colorful and large bill, which in some large species measures more than half the length of the body, is the hallmark of toucans. Despite its size, the toucan's bill is very light, being composed of bone struts filled with spongy tissue of keratin  between them. The bill has forward-facing serrations resembling teeth, which historically led naturalists to believe that toucans captured fish and were primarily carnivorous; today it is known that they eat mostly fruit. Researchers have discovered that the large bill of the toucan is a highly efficient thermoregulation system, though its size may still be advantageous in other ways.   It does aid in their feeding behavior (as they sit in one spot and reach for all fruit in range, thereby reducing energy expenditure), and it has also been theorized that the bill may intimidate smaller birds, so that the toucan may plunder nests undisturbed (see Diet below). Also, the beak allows the bird to reach deep into tree-holes to access food unavailable to other birds, and also to ransack suspended nests built by smaller birds. However, as there is no sexual dimorphism in coloration it is unlikely to be a sexual signal.\n\nA toucan's tongue is long (up to 14\u201315\u00a0cm, or 6\u00a0inches), narrow, grey, and singularly frayed on each side, adding to its sensitivity as an organ of taste.\n\nA structural complex probably unique to toucans involves the modification of several tail vertebrae.  The rear three vertebrae are fused and attached to the spine by a ball and socket joint. Because of this, toucans may snap their tail forward until it touches the head.   This is the posture in which they sleep, often appearing simply as a ball of feathers, with the tip of the tail sticking out over the head.\n\nHabitat \n\nToucans are native to Southern Mexico, Central America, the northern part of South America, and the Caribbean region. They generally live in tropical and sub-tropical regions.\n\nToucans are arboreal and typically lay 2\u201321 white eggs in their nests. They make their nests in tree hollows and holes excavated by other animals such as woodpeckers\u2014the toucan bill has very limited use as an excavation tool. When the eggs hatch, the young emerge completely naked, without any down.  Toucans are resident breeders and do not migrate. Toucans are usually found in pairs or small flocks.  They sometimes fence with their bills and wrestle, which scientists hypothesize they do to establish dominance hierarchies.\n\nDiet \n\nToucans are primarily frugivorous (fruit eating), but are opportunistically omnivorous and will take prey such as insects and small lizards.   Captive toucans have been reported to hunt insects actively in their cages, and it is possible to keep toucans on an insect-only diet. They also plunder nests of smaller birds, taking eggs and nestlings.Nadkarni, Nalini M. ; Wheelwright, Nathaniel T. (Editors). Monteverde: Ecology and Conservation of a Tropical Cloud Forest. Publisher: Oxford University Press, 2000. ISBN 978-0-19-513310-3  This probably provides a crucial addition of protein to their diet. Certainly, apart from being systematically predatory as well as frugivorous, like many omnivorous birds, they particularly prefer animal food for feeding their chicks.Short, Lester; Horne, Jennifer. Toucans, Barbets and Honeyguides. Publisher: Oxford University Press 2002. ISBN 978-0-19-854666-5 However, in their range, toucans are the dominant frugivores, and as such, play an extremely important ecological role as vectors for seed dispersal of fruiting trees. \n\nSystematic list\n\n* Genus Aulacorhynchus\u2014green toucanets (6\u201315 species, depending on taxonomy)\n* Genus Selenidera\u2014dichromatic toucanets (6 species)\n* Genus Andigena\u2014mountain toucans (4 species) \n* Genus Pteroglossus\u2014ara\u00e7aris (14 species, incl. saffron toucanet)\n* Genus Ramphastos\u2014typical toucans (about 12 species)\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThe mascot of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party is a blue and yellow colored toucan; party members are called tucanos for this reason.\n\nThe Toucan Tecs was a 1992 UK Television cartoon, broadcast on CiTV, about two detective toucans named Zippi and Zac.\n\nThe constellation Tucana, containing most of the Small Magellanic Cloud, is named after the toucan.\n\nThe mascot of the Kellogg's brand cereal Froot Loops is Toucan Sam.\n\nTwo toucans appear in the animated film Rio.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s Guinness (beer) advertising often featured a toucan.\nQuestion:\nThe Tocantino River (the name means Toucan's Beak) runs for 2640 km from South to North in which country?\nAnswer:\nBrazil\nPassage:\nSteve Young Biography (Football Player) - Infoplease\nSteve Young Biography (Football Player)\nBirthplace: Salt Lake City, Utah\nBest known as: Quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers\nSteve Young played quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers for 13 years, 1987-99, taking the starting job from highly popular quarterback Joe Montana in 1991.

Infestation by Botrytis requires moist conditions. If the weather stays wet, the damaging form, \"grey rot,\" can destroy crops of grapes. Grapes typically become infected with Botrytis when they are ripe. If they are then exposed to drier conditions and become partially raisined this form of infection brought about by the partial drying process is known as noble rot. Grapes when picked at a certain point during infestation can produce particularly fine and concentrated sweet wine. Some of the finest Botrytized wines are picked berry by berry in successive tries (French for \"selections\").\n\nOrigins\n\nAccording to Hungarian legend the first asz\u00fa (a wine using botrytised grapes) was made by Laczk\u00f3 M\u00e1t\u00e9 Szepsi in 1630. However, mention of wine made from botrytised grapes had already appeared in the Nomenklatura of Fabricius Bal\u00e1zs Sziksai, which was completed in 1576. A recently discovered inventory of asz\u00fa predates this reference by five years. When vineyard classification began in 1730 in the Tokaj region, one of the gradings given to the various terroirs centered on their potential to develop Botrytis cinerea.\n\nA popular myth is that the practice originated independently in Germany in 1775, where the Riesling producers at Schloss Johannisberg (Geisenheim, in the Rheingau region) traditionally awaited the say-so of the estate owner, Heinrich von Bibra, Bishop of Fulda, before cutting their grapes. In this year (so the legend goes), the abbey messenger was robbed en route to delivering the order to harvest and the cutting was delayed for three weeks, time enough for the Botrytis to take hold. The grapes were presumed worthless and given to local peasants,  who produced a surprisingly good, sweet wine which subsequently became known as Sp\u00e4tlese, or late harvest wine. In the following few years, several different classes of increasing must weight were introduced, and the original Sp\u00e4tlese was further elaborated, first into Auslese in 1787  and later Eiswein in 1858 (although Eiswein is usually made from grapes not affected by Botrytis). \n\nViticulture and uses\n\nInternationally renowned botrytised wines include the asz\u00fa of Tokaj-Hegyalja in Hungary and Slovakia (commonly called Tokaji, Tokajsk\u00e9 or Tokay), Sauternes from France - where the process is known as pourriture or pourriture noble, and Beerenauslese or Trockenbeerenauslese wines from Germany and Austria. Other wines of this type include the Romanian Gras\u0103 de Cotnari, French Coteaux du Layon, French Monbazillac, Austrian Ausbruch and South African Noble Late Harvest (NLH). Depending on conditions the grapes may be only minimally botrytized. Botrytis has also been imported for use by winemakers in California and Australia. In some cases inoculation occurs when spores are sprayed over the grapes, while some vineyards depend on natural inoculation from spores present in the environment.\nQuestion:\nNoble Rot is a fungus affecting which fruit?\nAnswer:\nWhite Grape\nPassage:\nRide of the Valkyries\nThe \"Ride of the Valkyries\" () is the popular term for the beginning of act 3 of Die Walk\u00fcre, the second of the four operas by Richard Wagner that constitute Der Ring des Nibelungen.\n\nAs a separate piece, the \"Ride\" is often heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes. Together with the \"Bridal Chorus\" from Lohengrin, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" is one of Wagner's best-known pieces.\n\nContext \n\nIn the Walk\u00fcre opera, the \"Ride\", which takes around eight minutes, begins in the prelude to the third act, building up successive layers of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal a mountain peak where four of the eight Valkyrie sisters of Br\u00fcnnhilde have gathered in preparation for the transportation of fallen heroes to Valhalla. As they are joined by the other four, the familiar tune is carried by the orchestra, while, above it, the Valkyries greet each other and sing their battle-cry. Apart from the song of the Rhinemaidens in Das Rheingold, it is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner's Ring cycle.\n\nPerformance history \n\nThe complete opera Die Walk\u00fcre was first performed on 26 June 1870 in the National Theatre Munich against the composer's intent. By January of the next year, Wagner was receiving requests for the \"Ride\" to be performed separately, but wrote that such a performance should be considered \"an utter indiscretion\" and forbade \"any such thing\".  However, the piece was still printed and sold in Leipzig, and Wagner subsequently wrote a complaint to the publisher Schott.  In the period up to the first performance of the complete Ring cycle, Wagner continued to receive requests for separate performances, his second wife Cosima noting \"Unsavoury letters arrive for R. \u2013 requests for the Ride of the Valkyries and I don't know what else.\"  Once the Ring had been given in Bayreuth in 1876, Wagner lifted the embargo. He himself conducted it in London on 12 May 1877, repeating it as an encore. \n\nOutside opera \n\nIn film \n\nUses in film include the original score for The Birth of a Nation (1915),  and What's Opera, Doc? (1957). \n\nThe \"Ride\" is also associated with Apocalypse Now (1979),  where the 1/9 Air Cavalry regiment plays the piece of music on helicopter-mounted loudspeakers during their assault on a Vietnamese village as psychological warfare and to motivate their own troops. \n\nIn military \n\nThe \"Ride\" is the regimental quick march of the British Parachute Regiment. \n\nIn music \n\nWithin the concert repertoire, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" remains a popular encore, especially when other Wagnerian extracts feature in the scheduled program. For example, at the BBC Proms it was performed as such by Klaus Tennstedt and the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 6 August 1992  and also by Valery Gergiev with the Kirov Orchestra on 28 August 2001. \n\nDiscography \n\nApart from where the \"Ride\" is included in the recordings of the Walk\u00fcre opera, it is a very popular piece, included in various popular classics anthologies. For instance in Deutsche Grammophon's 1991 Classicmania two CD album (von Karajan version), and in Brilliant Classics' 2011 Best Film Classics CD box, there included in the fifth CD, Opera at the Movies, with a reference to Apocalypse Now on the sleeve.\nQuestion:\n\"Who composed \"\"Ride of the Valkyries\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nWagner's\nPassage:\n35th Anniversary - Thirty-Fifth Wedding Anniversary\n35th Anniversary - Thirty-Fifth Wedding Anniversary\nMost Popular Song 35 Years Ago: \"PHYSICAL\" - Olivia Newton John\nPrice of Gasoline when you were married: $1.22 / gallon\nTRADITIONAL GIFT:  According to ancient  history, coral is said to have a magical power to prevent sterility. Coral is  mostly comprised of calcium carbonate. Coral has an opaque quality to it and  can be found in pink, white, orange, red and black. Angel-skin coral is  considered one of the most valuable of all coral. It is found near Japan and  used in most fine coral jewelry. The most valuable coral is called blood coral.  Found near Italy, blood coral is the most expensive coral in the world. Any  coral that contains parts of blood coral is immediately more valuable. Red  coral defends against plague and pestilence. It is thought that uncut coral  worn around the neck will lose its color if that person is in the presence of  another person who is going to die.\nMODERN GIFT:  Jade is another gift associated with the 35th anniversary and is  emerald green in color. The two minerals that mostly comprise jade are jadeite  and nephrite. Jadeite is the more sought after and valuable of the  two. The best jadeite is found in Myanmar in Asia. Jade can also be found in  yellow, pink, purple and black. The most common color is emerald green. In  ancient times it was thought that jade protected the kidney, liver, spleen,  heart, larynx, thymus and thyroid. Jade was associated with increased body  strength and advanced longevity.\nGEMSTONE:  The emerald is known for  its brilliant green shine. This shine comes from a high content of chromium.  Genuine emeralds contain trace amounts of iron, which actually increases the  value of the stone. Some of the best emeralds in the world are found in South  America, particularly Columbia and Brazil. Ancient Egyptians buried emeralds  with mummies. Some of the oldest emeralds in the world were harvested from the  infamous \u201cCleopatra mines\u201d. Emeralds are known to be very tough gems, but they  are prone to cracks on the surface, which could devalue the gem. For this  reason, before the gems are sold to the public, they are treated with epoxy or  oils to fix or prevent any cracks and improve the transparency.\nWe hope that you have  enjoyed reading this historical information about the 35th wedding anniversary.

She has climbed Mount Fuji in Japan as well as the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps, among others. By 1972, Tabei was a recognized mountain climber in Japan.\n\nEverest expedition\n\nThe team of JWEE (Japanese Women\u2019s Everest Expedition) consisted of fifteen, mostly working women including teachers, a computer programmer and a juvenile counselor. Two of them, including Tabei, were mothers.  JWEE, headed by Eiko Hisano, was a part of the Ladies Climbing Club, founded in 1969. After successful summit of Annapurna III on May 19, 1970 by Tabei and Hiroko Hirakawa,  LCC decided to attack Mount Everest.\n\nAlthough they obtained last-minute funding from Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper and Nippon Television, all the members still had to pay an amount that was almost equal to Japan\u2019s average salary. To save money, they would use recycled car sheets to sew up water-proof pouches and over-gloves. They purchased goose feather from China and made their own sleeping bags. Students at school collected unused packets of jam for their teachers. \n\nAfter a long training period, they began the expedition early in 1975 when they traveled to Kathmandu. They used the same route Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay took in 1953.\n\nIn early May the women were camping at 6,300 meters when an avalanche struck their camp. The women, including Tabei and the guides, were buried under the snow. Tabei lost consciousness for approximately six minutes until her Sherpa guide dug her out. Twelve days after the avalanche, Tabei became the first female to reach the summit of Mount Everest.\n\nLater activities\n\nOn 28 June 1992 Tabei finished the climb of Puncak Jaya to become the first woman to complete the Seven Summits. \n\nTabei had a goal to climb the highest peak in every country in the world and continues to work on ecological concerns. Tabei is the director of Himalayan Adventure Trust of Japan, an organization working on a global level to preserve mountain environments.\nQuestion:\nIn 1975, Junko Tabei became the first woman to reach the summit of which mountain?\nAnswer:\nMt.

In the apocryphal Book of Jubilees, his mother's name is Dinah.\n\nJubilees adds that Jared married Beraka, and the Bible speaks of Jared having become father to many sons and daughters. Of those children, only Enoch is named specifically, born when Jared was 162 years old (, , , , ). Enoch went on to marry Edna, according to Jubilees, and the sole named grandchild of Jared is Enoch's son Methuselah, the longest-living human mentioned in the Bible (, , ).\n\nAdditionally, Jared was a forefather of Noah and his three sons. Jared's age was given as 962 years old when he died, making him the second-oldest person mentioned in the Hebrew Bible and the Septuagint.

Fielding never admitted to writing the work, but it is widely considered to be his.  It is a direct attack on the then-popular novel Pamela (1740) by Fielding's contemporary and rival Samuel Richardson and is composed, like Pamela, in epistolary form.\n\nPublishing history\n\nShamela was originally published anonymously on 4 April 1741 and sold for one shilling and sixpence. A second edition came out on 3 November that same year which was partly reimpressed and partly reset where emendations were made.\n\nA pirated edition was printed in Dublin in 1741 as well. Reprint editions have subsequently appeared as texts for academic study.\n\nPlot summary\n\nShamela is written as a shocking revelation of the true events which took place in the life of Pamela Andrews, the main heroine of Pamela. From Shamela we learn that, instead of being a kind, humble and chaste servant-girl, Pamela (whose true name turns out to be Shamela) is in fact a wicked and lascivious creature and former prostitute, scheming to entrap her master, Squire Booby, into marriage.\n\nThemes and style\n\nThe novel is a sustained parody of, and direct response to, the stylistic failings and moral hypocrisy that Fielding saw in Richardson's Pamela. Reading Shamela amounts to re-reading Pamela through a deforming magnifying glass; Richardson's text is rewritten in a way that reveals its hidden implications, to subvert and desecrate it.  \n\nRichardson's epistolary tale of a resolute servant girl, armed only with her 'virtue' to battle against her master's attempts at seduction, had become an overnight literary sensation in 1741. The implicit moral message \u2013 that a girl's chastity has eventual value as a commodity \u2013 as well as the awkwardness of the epistolary form in dealing with ongoing events, and the triviality of the detail which the form necessitates, were some of the main targets of Fielding's travesty.\n\nRecent criticism has explored the ways in which Pamela in fact dramatises its own weaknesses. From this perspective, Fielding's work may be seen as a development of possibilities already encoded in Richardson's work, rather than a simple attack.  Another novel by Fielding parodying Pamela, albeit not so explicitly, is The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews and his Friend, Mr. Abraham Adams (February 1742), more commonly known as Joseph Andrews.\nQuestion:\n\u2018Shamela\u2019 (1741) was a parody of \u2018Pamela\u2019 (1740).

In 1920, the average water level was about 26 meters (85 feet) below sea level. By 1977, the water level had dropped by about 3 meters (10 feet). Then, it rose over the next two decades flooding infrastructure, causing large amounts of economic damage, and forcing tens of thousands of people to move. Then in the mid-1990s, the Caspian Sea began dropping again. The water level now stands at about 27 meters below sea level.\nWith global climate change looming in the coming decades, researchers are attempting to understand all the factors that control the water level on the Caspian. Key factors include: how much rain falls; how much water gets diverted into reservoirs for human use; how much water evaporates before reaching the lake; how do tectonic activity and oil extraction change the height of the land.\nNew research suggests that dust storms may have an effect as well. A study by scientists from the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics and from Istanbul Technical University details how airborne dust affects the region\u2019s climate and water cycle in several ways. For instance, dust particles absorb sunlight, so a cloud of dust can change the distribution of heat in the atmosphere. Specifically, dust clouds warm the atmosphere and cool the water surface below. Such changes reduce the amount of evaporation at the water surface, make the atmosphere less turbulent, and reduce convection (heat rising in the atmosphere). Together, these changes reduce the likelihood of rain.\nThe researchers concluded that dust storms over the Caspian Sea likely reduce lake surface temperatures by 1 to 2 degrees Celsius (1.8  to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), while increasing evaporation by about 0.5 millimeters (0.02 inches) per day. This can lead to a drop in lake levels equivalent to 10 millimeters (0.4 inches) per year. In their model, the researchers used observations of dust collected by several satellites sensors, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites, the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), and the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWIFS).\nOn June 6, 2016, the MODIS instrument on NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite captured this image of a thick layer of dust over the southern Caspian Sea.  Notice how the dust has almost completely obscured the water. The dust particles absorb heat from the Sun rather than allowing it to heat the water surface. Dust storms like this are common over the Caspian in spring and summer.\nReferences\nQuestion:\nWhat body of water is 86 feet (26 meters) below sea level?\nAnswer:\nApsheron Threshold\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nThe Ten Commandments (1956) on iTunes\nThe Ten Commandments (1956) on iTunes\nOpen iTunes to preview, buy, and download this movie.\nAbout the Movie\nBased on the Holy Scriptures, with additional dialogue by several other hands, The Ten Commandments was the last film directed by Cecil B. DeMille. The story relates the life of Moses, from the time he was discovered in the bullrushes as an infant by the pharoah's daughter, to his long, hard struggle to free the Hebrews from their slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. Moses (Charlton Heston) starts out \"in solid\" as Pharoah's adopted son (and a whiz at designing pyramids, dispensing such construction-site advice as \"Blood makes poor mortar\"), but when he discovers his true Hebrew heritage, he attempts to make life easier for his people. Banished by his jealous half-brother Rameses (Yul Brynner), Moses returns fully bearded to Pharoah's court, warning that he's had a message from God and that the Egyptians had better free the Hebrews post-haste if they know what's good for them. Only after the Deadly Plagues have decimated Egypt does Rameses give in. As the Hebrews reach the Red Sea, they discover that Rameses has gone back on his word and plans to have them all killed. But Moses rescues his people with a little Divine legerdemain by parting the Seas. Later, Moses is again confronted by God on Mt. Sinai, who delivers unto him the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile, the Hebrews, led by the duplicitous Dathan (Edward G. Robinson), are forgetting their religion and behaving like libertines. \"Where's your Moses now?\" brays Dathan in the manner of a Lower East Side gangster. He soon finds out. A remake of his 1923 silent film, DeMille's The Ten Commandments may not be the most subtle and sophisticated entertainment ever concocted, but it tells its story with a clarity and vitality that few Biblical scholars have ever been able to duplicate. It is very likely the most eventful 219 minutes ever recorded to film\u0097and who's to say that Nefertiri (Anne Baxter) didn't make speeches like, \"Oh, Moses, Moses, you splendid, stubborn, adorable fool\"?\nCredits\nAverage Rating: 7.5/10\nTop Critics' Reviews\nFresh: DeMille remains conventional with the motion picture as an art form. The eyes of the onlooker are filled with spectacle. Emotional tug is sometimes lacking. \u2013 Variety Staff, Variety, Jul 7, 2010\nFresh: There is no other picture like it. There will be none. If it could be summed up in a word, the word would be sublime. And the man responsible for that, when all is said and done is Cecil B. DeMille. \u2013 James Powers, Hollywood Reporter, Apr 7, 2015\nFresh: DeMille's direction of the action is superb and the various roles are played with feeling by a large and competent cast, headed by Charlton Heston. \u2013 Kate Cameron, New York Daily News, Dec 10, 2014\nFresh: With a running time of nearly four hours, Cecil B. De Mille's last feature and most extravagant blockbuster is full of the absurdities and vulgarities one expects, but it isn't boring for a minute. \u2013 Jonathan Rosenbaum, Chicago Reader, Jun 24, 2010\nQuestion:\n\"In the 1956 film \"\"The Ten Commandments\"\", who played Moses?\"\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
