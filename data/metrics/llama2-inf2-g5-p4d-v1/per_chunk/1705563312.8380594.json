Furthermore, it can be characterized as one of the few Mediterranean winds that do not necessarily die out at the end of the day and can easily last more than three to six days. See my climate page for Greek weather statistics.\nThe onset is the monsoonal\neffect of the summer season that leads to the development of an   intense heat trough over southern Asia extending westward over the Anatolian plateau. Higher pressure dominates over the relatively cooler surface of the   Mediterranean Sea, and settled, dry weather persists.    Northerly winds prevail along the Greek coast during the   winter also, but only those northerly winds occurring between May and   November are considered Etesian. The pressure gradients necessary to drive the   Meltemi result from a combination of:\nThe monsoonal effect during the summer that leads to a low pressure      trough over Turkey. Etesian winds flow from a high pressure ridge over     the Balkans toward the trough. During a strong Etesian, the trough may     extend relatively far to the west and beyond Rhodes . It may also form     a closed low, resulting in almost calm winds at Rhodes.\nSynoptic conditions leading to anti-cyclogenesis\nover the Balkans.\nA jet-effect increase of wind caused by channelling of the wind between      islands and mountain valleys. These effects tend to render wind reports     from certain locations unrepresentative. In the lee of Crete, katabatic     flow off the mountains generates gusty winds similar to the F\u00f6hn\nof the     Alps. The mountain valleys tend to channel the flow which increases the     wind velocity.\nThe surface flow is generally divergent in an Etesian situation, and    the weather is generally thought to be dry with clear skies. However,    this is mostly true only during the main yacht charter season of July and August    when scattered altocumulus appear a day before an Etesian, and the only other clouds are orographic\ntypes that may form on the lee    side of islands in stronger Etesian winds.\nThe Meltemi occurs mainly during the summer season (June - September with 70%), but also in May and October one may frequently experience this dry wind.\nOne should anticipate its maximum during July and August.\nUsually the wind starts in the early afternoon reaching 4-5 Beaufort\nand dies out at sun set. However, not uncommonly it reaches 5-7 Bft during the day, perseveres during the night and blows 5-7 Bft again the next day; a pattern which can easily be repeated over many days, sometimes even up to ten days.\nIf during this period sailing to windward cannot be avoided, it can be very wise to lift anchor at dawn and to cover as many miles as possible before the wind starts\n.\n\u00a0\nImportant guidelines\nDue to the katabatic nature of the meltemi one can experience strong fall winds on the leeward side of the islands, notorious are Kea (we did survive though), Evvia, Tinos and Andros , Folegandros , Kos , Serifos , Amorgos and Sifnos . An orographic cloud to leeward of the mountain spells danger.\nWhen the wind encounters very high cliffs on the North shore of an island, a calm - extending several miles off shore - can be expected. Good examples are Amorgos, Paros and Naxos .\nIn the wide corridor between de dodecanese and cycladic islands the Meltemi blows undisturbed over 100 miles. Within six hours of a 30-knot wind, the waves can reach heights over three meters. The adverse currents make these waves steeper, which can be seriously dangerous for yachts smaller than 10 meter.\nThe Ionian Sea in the west of Greece is not affected by these Etesian winds but experiences a reliable Maistro wind throughout the sailing season. For an explanation on the Maistro wind please visit my page on Sailing routes in the Ionian .\nExpect funnelling winds, which can make certain straits dangerous to pass because of currents and higher wind velocities. Classical areas are: between Andros and Evvia (currents up to 5 knots!); between Ikaria and Samos till the Fournoi-archipelago; Between Paros and Naxos; North side of Amorgos; West side of Karpathos. Sometimes South of both Kea and Kythnos .\nTell-tales for your own Meltemi 24-36 hour prediction:\nHigher predicted atmospheric pressure over the Balkan/Northern Aegean.\nA sudden drop in humidity (first morning without dew on deck).\nScattered little altocumulus clouds one day in advance.\nA clear improvement of visibility combined with a raise in atmospheric pressure (4 hPa within 12 hours).\nFortunately, the possibility of stronger winds is actually the only shortcoming of the Aegean. There are hardly any shallow waters, no tides to speak off and no fog (good visibility!): all the ingredients for perfect yacht charter vacations .\nRelated pages:\nQuestion:\nWhat type of weather condition is a Meltemi?\nAnswer:\nBlustery\nPassage:\nRump (animal)\nThe rump or croup, in the external morphology of an animal, is the portion of the posterior dorsum that is posterior to the loins and anterior to the tail.  Anatomically, the rump corresponds to the sacrum.  \n\nThe tailhead or dock is the beginning of the tail, where the tail joins the rump.  It is known also as the base or root of the tail, and corresponds to the human sacrococcygeal symphysis.  In some mammals the tail may be said to consist of the tailbone (meaning the bony column, muscles, and skin) and the skirt (meaning the long hairs growing from the tailbone).  In birds, similarly, the tail consists of tailbone and tailfan (tail fan).\n\nSome animals are subjected to docking, the amputation of the tailbone at or near the dock.  These include dogs, cats, sheep, pigs, and horses.  Humans have a remnant tail, the coccyx, and the human equivalent of docking is coccygectomy.\n\nUsage\n\nUsage varies from animal to animal.  Birds and cattle are said to have a rump and tailhead.  Dogs are said to have a rump and dock.  Horses are said to have a croup    (sometimes rump),  thigh or haunch, buttock, and dock.\n\nBirds\n\nIn bird anatomy, the rump is the body immediately above the tail.  The color of plumage on the rump is a characteristic widely used by ornithologists to distinguish between related species, and sometimes also between males and females of the same species. Similarly, the silhouette of the tailfan is a characteristic widely used for purposes of identification, particularly in the field.\n\nSome birds have a food reservoir pouch in the esophagus that is known as a croup.\n\nDogs\n\nIn some breeds it is traditional for tails to be cut off (docked) at the dock.\n\nHorses\n\nIn horse anatomy, the croup refers specifically to the topline of the horse's hindquarters and surrounding musculature, beginning at the hip, extending proximate to the sacral vertebrae and stopping at the dock of the tail (where the coccygeal vertebrae begin). Below the croup is the thigh or haunch. Behind the thigh is the buttock.\nOn horses appearing in parades and other public ceremonies, the croup may be decorated with a pattern in the horse's hair, formed by applying hair gel or spray, then brushing patches of hair in opposite directions.\n\nApplied to horses, the term \"dock\" has two additional uses. Its meaning may be extended to either the entire tail minus the skirt (i.e., synonymous with tailbone)  or the tailhead only.  In other equidae, it encompasses most of the tailbone, as most of that portion of the tail does not have long hairs.  A lack of long hairs can be natural, as in zebras, donkeys, and the Przewalski horse, or artificial, the result of pulling, trimming, or shaving part of the skirt (see Horse grooming).\n\nA sponge used to wash the hairless skin on the underside of the dock and other regions under the tail, protected by the dock, is called a dock sponge. Thus, the meaning of \"dock\" has been used to refer to the orifices beneath the dock, specifically the anus and vagina, creating a misapprehension that \"dock\" refers to the anus, as in, a horse's fundamental orifice is its dock.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the croup of an animal, such as a horse?\nAnswer:\nRump\nPassage:\nDaniel Gabriel Fahrenheit\nDaniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (;; 24 May 1686 \u2013 16 September 1736) was a Polish-born German  physicist, engineer, and glass blower who is best known for inventing the mercury-in-glass thermometer (1714), and for developing a temperature scale now named after him. \n\nBiography \n\nFahrenheit was born in the city of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk), Pomeranian Voivodeship in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, but lived most of his life in the Dutch Republic. The Fahrenheits were a German Hanse merchant family who had lived in several Hanseatic cities. Fahrenheit's great-grandfather had lived in Rostock, and research suggests that the Fahrenheit family originated in Hildesheim.  Daniel's grandfather moved from Kneiphof in K\u00f6nigsberg (present-day Kaliningrad) to Danzig and settled there as a merchant in 1650. His son, Daniel Fahrenheit (the father of the subject of this article), married Concordia Schumann, daughter of a well-known Danzig business family. Daniel was the eldest of the five Fahrenheit children (two sons, three daughters) who survived childhood. His sister, Virginia Elizabeth Fahrenheit, married Benjamin Ephraim Krueger of an aristocratic family from Danzig. \n\nDaniel Gabriel  began training as a merchant in Amsterdam after his parents died on 14 August 1701 from eating poisonous mushrooms. However, Fahrenheit's interest in natural science led him to begin studies and experimentation in that field. From 1717, he traveled to Berlin, Halle, Leipzig, Dresden, Copenhagen, and also to his hometown, where his brother still lived. During that time, Fahrenheit met or was in contact with Ole R\u00f8mer, Christian Wolff, and Gottfried Leibniz. In 1717, Fahrenheit settled in The Hague as a glassblower, making barometers, altimeters, and thermometers. From 1718 onwards, he lectured in chemistry in Amsterdam.  He visited England in 1724 and was the same year elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.  Fahrenheit died in The Hague and was buried there at the Kloosterkerk (Cloister Church).\n\nIn 2012, scientists made a computer image of his face using photos of his relatives. \n\nFahrenheit scale \n\nAccording to Fahrenheit's 1724 article,  he determined his scale by reference to three fixed points of temperature.  The lowest temperature was achieved by preparing a frigorific mixture of ice, water, and ammonium chloride (a salt), and waiting for it to reach equilibrium.  The thermometer then was placed into the mixture and the liquid in the thermometer allowed to descend to its lowest point.  The thermometer's reading there was taken as 0\u00a0\u00b0F.  The second reference point was selected as the reading of the thermometer when it was placed in still water when ice was just forming on the surface.  This was assigned as 32\u00a0\u00b0F.  The third calibration point, taken as 96\u00a0\u00b0F, was selected as the thermometer's reading when the instrument was placed under the arm or in the mouth.\n\nFahrenheit came up with the idea that mercury boils around 300 degrees on this temperature scale. Work by others showed that water boils about 180 degrees above its freezing point.  The Fahrenheit scale later was redefined to make the freezing-to-boiling interval exactly 180 degrees, a convenient value as 180 is a highly composite number, meaning that it is evenly divisible into many fractions. It is because of the scale's redefinition that normal body temperature today is taken as 98.2 degrees,  whereas it was 96 degrees on Fahrenheit's original scale. \n\nThe Fahrenheit scale was the primary temperature standard for climatic, industrial and medical purposes in English-speaking countries until the 1960s.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the first name of Mr. Fahrenheit, after whom the temperature scale was named?\nAnswer:\nGABRIEL\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nGrace Slick w.

The smallest thrush may be the forest rock thrush, at 21 g and . However, the shortwings, which have ambiguous alliances with both thrushes and Old World flycatchers, can be even smaller. The lesser shortwing averages 12 cm. The largest thrush is the blue whistling thrush, at 178 g and 33 cm. The great thrush is similar in length, but less heavily built.  Most species are grey or brown in colour, often with speckled underparts.\n\nThey are insectivorous, but most species also eat worms, land snails, and fruit. Many species are permanently resident in warm climates, while others migrate to higher latitudes during summer, often over considerable distances.\n\nThrushes build cup-shaped nests, sometimes lining them with mud. They lay two to five speckled eggs, sometimes laying two or more clutches per year. Both parents help in raising the young.\n\nThe songs of some species, including members of the genera Catharus, Myadestes, Sialia and Turdus, are considered to be among the most beautiful in the avian world.  \n\nEcology\n\nTurdidae species spread the seeds of plants, contributing to the dispersal of many species and the recovery of ecosystems.\n\nPlants have limited seed dispersal mobility away from the parent plant and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time.\n\nMany bats and birds rely heavily on fruits for their diet, including birds in the families Cotingidae, Columbidae, Trogonidae, Turdidae, and Rhamphastidae. While eating fruit, these animals swallow seeds and then later regurgitate them or pass them in their faeces. Such ornithochory has been a major mechanism of seed dispersal across ocean barriers.\n\nOther seeds may stick to the feet or feathers of birds, and in this way may travel long distances. Seeds of grasses, spores of algae, and the eggs of molluscs and other invertebrates commonly establish in remote areas after long journeys of this sort. The Turdidae  have a great ecological importance because some populations migrate long distances and disperse the seeds of endangered plant species at new sites, helping to eliminate inbreeding and increasing the genetic diversity of local flora.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nThe taxonomic treatment of this large family has varied significantly in recent years. Traditionally, the Turdidae included the small Old World species, like the nightingale and European robin in the subfamily Saxicolinae, but most authorities now place this group in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae.\n\nThe family formerly included more species. At the time of the publication of the third edition of Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World in 2003, the genera Myophonus, Alethe, Brachypteryx and Monticola were included in Turdidae. Subsequent molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the species in these four genera are more closely related to species in the family Muscicapidae. As a consequence, these four genera are now placed in Muscicapidae. In contrast, the genus Cochoa which had previously been placed in Muscicapidae was shown to belong in Turdidae.\n\nGenera\n\nFAMILY: TURDIDAE\n* Genus Neocossyphus: rufous thrushes (four species) \u2013 related to Myadestes\n* Genus Geokichla: (21 species)\n* Genus Zoothera: Asian thrushes (some 15 species, one recently extinct)\n* Genus Ixoreus: varied thrush \u2013 related to other New World genera\n* Genus Ridgwayia: Aztec thrush \u2013 related to Hylocichla\n* Genus Cataponera: Sulawesi thrush\n\n* Genus Grandala: grandala\n* Genus Sialia: bluebirds (three species)\n* Genus Myadestes: solitaires (10\u201311 living species, two or three recently extinct, includes formerly recognized genus Phaeornis)\n* Genus Cichlopsis: rufous-brown solitaire \u2013 related to Catharus\n* Genus Catharus: typical American thrushes and nightingale-thrushes (12 species)\n* Genus Hylocichla: wood thrush\n* Genus Entomodestes: solitaires (2 species) \u2013 related to Catharus\n* Genus Turdus: true thrushes (some 65 species, one recently extinct)\n* Genus Cochoa: cochoas (four species)\n* Genus Chlamydochaera: fruithunter\n\n* Genus Platycichla: (two species) \u2013 part of a South American group within Turdus\n* Genus Nesocichla: Tristan thrush or starchy \u2013 part of a South American group within Turdus\n\n* Genus Cichlherminia: forest thrush \u2013 genus paraphyletic with Turdus\n\n* Genus Psophocichla: groundscraper thrush\n\nNow usually considered a distinct family distantly related to Picathartes:\n\n* Genus Chaetops: rock-jumpers (two species)\n\nFor other species previously in the Turdidae, see Muscicapidae and chats.\nQuestion:\nIf a bird is described as 'Turdoid', to which family does it belong?\nAnswer:\nMan from uncle\nPassage:\nMarcus Chamat\nMarcus Chamat (pronounced shuh-mat) (born 6 May 1975, in Borlange, Sweden) is a professional eight-ball and nine-ball pool player.

This pretty basin was once a thriving transport hub. Now, traditional narrowboats and elegant black and white iron footbridges sit side-by-side with modern bars and restaurants. Close by is luxury shopping centre the Mailbox, with its stylish clothing shops and cafes.\u00a0\nAmong the cargos that once travelled on the canal was chocolate crumb\u00a0to the Cadbury factory. Today, this is Cadbury World, a great day out if you have a sweet tooth.\nChocolate and guillotines\nAt Kings Norton Junction, the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal joins under permanently open guillotine gates. Opposite the junction is an attractive toll house with its board showing the charges.\nThe Lickey Hills are pierced by three long tunnels. The canal was realigned to allow the building of the M42. Tardebigge Wharf, with its dry dock, maintenance yard, workers' cottages, and historic warehouse remains the main base for maintenance on the canal, and is a great place to start a walk.\u00a0 It was here that Tom Rolt met Robert Aickman, which led to the creation of the Inland Waterways Association.\nHistoric meeting\nAll 58 locks are in the second half of the canal, as the canal descends through rural Worcestershire. The Tardebigge lock flight has 30 locks in just over two miles, making it the longest in the country.\nHanbury Hall (National Trust) can easily be reached by a pleasant walk across the fields from Astwood Bottom Lock. Hanbury Junction marks the connection with the Droitwich Junction Canal, linked with the Droitwich Barge Canal and offers a route to the River Severn\u00a0at Hawford. You might like to take a short walk down the Hanbury Flight, which was rebuilt by volunteers. Hanbury's other claim to fame is that it is said to be the real-life counterpart of Radio 4's Ambridge, home of The Archers.\nAround Bilford, the countryside is left behind as the canal begins to encroach on the city environs. The Commandery was the headquarters of Charles Stuart before the Battle of Worcester in 1651.\nAhead lies Diglis Basins and two wide locks accessing the Severn. Once very busy with commercial traffic, the working boats have long been replaced by pleasure craft. Worcester Cathedral stares down imposingly on travellers entering the river.\nBoating\nThe Worcester & Birmingham Canal is a justifiably popular cruising route and is now part of both the Avon and Stourport Cruising Rings. With 58 locks in all it is well suited to energetic crews, or those who don't mind taking their time.\nDownload Worcester & Birmingham Canal towpath guidance for cyclists\nThe history\nThe purpose of the Worcester & Birmingham Canal was to give a much shorter link between Birmingham and the river Severn.\u00a0Against opposition from other canals, it obtained its Act in 1791.\u00a0Construction started at the Birmingham end but progress was slow.\u00a0The canal was intended to be broad (for boats up to 14ft wide), which is why the first three tunnels have this width, but shortage of money meant that the section from Tardebigge to Worcester was built only wide enough for narrow boats.\u00a0It opened throughout in 1815.\nWater supply was a major problem and a source of conflict with connecting canals.\u00a0 At first the Birmingham Canal and the W&B were physically separated by what was known as Worcester Bar, but in 1815 they agreed a compromise whereby the two canals would be linked by a lock, with the W&B paying a compensation toll for all traffic passing through.\nThe guillotine lock by Kings Norton Junction on the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal enabled each canal to preserve its water, regardless of the respective levels.\nExperimental vertical boat lift\nTardebigge top lock is particularly deep because it was the site of a experimental vertical boat lift, which proved not to be robust enough.\u00a0 After a few months it was replaced by a conventional lock \u2014 but as a canal\u2019s water usage is largely determined by its deepest lock, it would have been better if it had been replaced by two locks.\u00a0\nThe volume of traffic never lived up to expectations, though it improved once the Gloucester & Berkeley Canal opened in 1827. Salt had been found when the canal was being cut at Stoke Prior, and the industry which developed became an important source of traffic.\u00a0 Worcester gas works and other canalside industries used coal brought by the canal.\nRailway competition\nHowever, from 1841 railway competition took away much of the business and in 1868 losses were so severe that a receiver was appointed. The canal was saved by being bought in 1874 by the Sharpness New Docks Company (which by then owned the Gloucester & Sharpness Canal). Under enterprising management new traffic was sought, and the canal survived until nationalisation in 1948.\nThe last commercial traffics were coal from Cannock to Worcester and chocolate crumb from Worcester to Bourneville, ceasing in 1960 and 1961 respectively.\nQuestion:\nThe English cities of Gloucester and Worcester are on which river?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
