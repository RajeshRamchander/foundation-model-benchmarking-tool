Subsequent revisions of the book were published in 1986, 1989, 2000, and 2008.\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe first few chapters following the brief introduction about Bundy's birth and family describe Rule's friendship with Bundy, her first impressions of him, and her reluctance to consider the evidence that he might be responsible for the crimes of which he was accused.\n\nThe events of the Chi Omega murders at Florida State University in January 1978 are written in third person, but not omnisciently, as the perpetrator is not identified as being Bundy, thus keeping the documentation of these events in-sync with the knowledge available to officers at the time.\n\nIt is not until Bundy's capture and trials in Florida that Rule fully accepts that Bundy is a serial killer. She finds the idea shocking to the point that she \"[runs] to the ladies room and throws up.\"  An afterword, following Rule's lament for Bundy and his victims, describes the Kimberly Leach trial. The 1989 update outlines Bundy's execution, and the 2000 update touches on many things, including various women claiming to have encountered Bundy in the 1970s, Robert Keppel's retirement from detective work and his employment at the University of Washington, and Bundy's possible involvement in the unsolved disappearance of Ann Marie Burr, a girl who disappeared in 1961 when Bundy was 14. \n\nA 2008 update of the book includes more stories from women who have contacted Rule with stories of their \"near-miss\" contacts with a man they believe was Ted Bundy, and also a \"Ted Bundy FAQ\" section in which Rule tries to answer the questions most frequently asked by readers, including the fact that he was not responsible for the 1973 murder of Kathy Merry Devine, for which he was long suspected. DNA testing linked that killing to an ex-convict named William Cosden, who was subsequently tried and convicted of her murder.\n\nFilm adaptation\n\nIn 2003, The Stranger Beside Me was adapted into a made-for-TV film, starring Billy Campbell as Bundy and Barbara Hershey as Rule.\nQuestion:\nAnn Rules book The Stranger Beside Me, is about what serial killer, assumed to have murdered 35 people, before hitting the electric chair in Starke, Florida on January 24, 1989?\nAnswer:\nMelissa Smith (murder victim)\nPassage:\nGulf of Bothnia\nThe Gulf of Bothnia (; ) is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It is situated between Finland's west coast and Sweden's east coast. In the south of the gulf lie the \u00c5land Islands, between the Sea of \u00c5land and the Archipelago Sea.\n\nName\n\nBothnia is a latinization. The Swedish name \"Bottenviken\" was originally just \"Botn(en)\" with botn being Old Norse for \"gulf\" or \"bay\";  which is also the meaning of the second element \"vik\".\n\nThe name botn was applied to the Gulf of Bothnia as Helsingjabotn in Old Norse, after H\u00e4lsingland, which at the time referred to the coastland west of the gulf. Later, botten was applied to the regions V\u00e4sterbotten on the western side and \u00d6sterbotten the eastern side (\"East Bottom\" and \"West Bottom\"). The Finnish name of \u00d6sterbotten, Pohjanmaa, or \"Pohja\"-land, gives a hint as to the meaning in both languages: pohja means both \"bottom\" and \"north.\"\n\nBotn/botten is cognate with the English word bottom, and it might be part of a general north European distinction of lowlands, as opposed to highlands, such as the Netherlandic region, Samogitia (Lithuanian), and Sambia (Russia).\n\nA second possibility is that botten follows an alternative Scandinavian connotation of 'furthermost'. Thus, the Gulf of Bothnia would be the farthest extent of the Ocean.\n\nJulius Pokorny gives the extended Indo-European root as *bhudh-m(e)n with a *bhudh-no- variant, from which the Latin fundus, as in fundament, is derived. The original meaning of English north, from Indo-European *ner- \"under\", indicates an original sense of \"lowlands\" for \"bottomlands\". On the other hand, by \"north\" the classical authors usually meant \"outermost\", as the northern lands were outermost to them.\n\nThe origin of the word is indeed very ancient, belonging to a period before the world discoveries by the Portuguese. Until then, North was not seen as the magnetic top of the world, East being the normal orientation of a map. \n\nAlso, in Saami, the cardinal directions were named according to the different parts of the typical tent used by this nomadic people. The door of the tent was traditionally pointed South, in the most sunny direction, and the bottom of the tent would be aligned with the North. Thus the origin of the word 'Pohja' in its use as \"North\". Deriving as well from this logic is the affinity in the Finnish language of the words 'eteinen', meaning \"entrance room/hall\" and 'Etel\u00e4', \"South\".\n\nGeography\n\nExtent\n\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the southern limit of the Gulf of Bothnia as follows: \n\nFrom Simpn\u00e4sklubb (59\u00b054'N) in Sweden, to Fl\u00f6tjan, Lagsk\u00e6r [sic], F\u00e6st\u00f6rne [sic], K\u00f6kars\u00f6rn, and V\u00e6n\u00f6-Kalksk\u00e6r [sic] to the SW point of Hang\u00f6udde (Hang\u00f6 Head, 59\u00b049'N) in Finland, thus including the Aland islands and adjacent shoals and channels in the Gulf of Bothnia.\n\nGeophysical data\n\nThe gulf is 725\u00a0km (450\u00a0mi) long, 80\u2013240\u00a0km (50-150\u00a0mi) wide and has an average depth of 60 m (200\u00a0ft, 33 fathoms). The maximum depth is 295 m (965\u00a0ft, 161 fathoms). The surface area is 117,000\u00a0km\u00b2 (45,200 sq mi). The northernmost point is situated in T\u00f6re in the Bothnian Bay. its coordinates are 65\u00b0 54'07\" N 22\u00b0 39'00 E. \n\nThe depth and surface area of Gulf if Bothnia are constantly decreasing, as the land is rising after it had been pressed down by the continental ice during last ice age.  The rise is 80 cm every hundred years. \n\nInto the gulf flow a number of rivers from both sides; consequently, a salinity gradient exists from north to south.\nIn the south the water is the normal brackish water of the Baltic Sea, but in the north, in the Bothnian Bay, the salinity is so low,  from 0.4% near Kvarken to 0.2% in the northernmost part,  and many freshwater fish such as the pike, whitefish and perch thrive in it.\n\nBeing nearly fresh, the gulf is frozen over five months every year. The icing of the Baltic Sea begins and ends in the northern Gulf of Bothnia. Traffic restrictions for ice breaker assistance are typically in force for all the gulf from late January to late April and for the northernmost ports from the middle of December to the middle of May. \n\nGeological history\n\nFor the geological history of the entire region, refer to the Baltic Sea.\n\nHistory\n\nSome historians suggest that the adventurer Ottar was referring to the Gulf of Bothnia when he spoke of the Kven Sea in the 9th century. It is also possible that Claudius Clavus's usage of the term Mare Gotticus in the 15th century refers to the Gulf of Bothnia.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe land surrounding the Gulf of Bothnia is heavily forested. Trees are logged, then transported to the coast for milling. The gulf is also important for oil transport to the coastal cities and ore transport to steel mills, for instance in Raahe.\n\nIn terms of  tonnage in international traffic,  the largest ports on the Finnish side are Rauma, Kokkola and Tornio. The main ports of the Swedish side are in Lule\u00e5, Skellefte\u00e5, Ume\u00e5, Sundsvall, G\u00e4vle and Hargshamn. In Lule\u00e5, iron ore pellets are exported and coal is imported. G\u00e4vle is Sweden's third-largest container port. It also ships forest products and oil.  The Gulf of Bothnia, ice breakers assist the ports needed in average half a year, when the Gulf of Finland, the season is only three months. \n\nThere is some fishery, mainly Baltic herring, for domestic needs. A persistent problem has been pollution, because the sea is enclosed by a large drainage basin and is poorly connected to fresher waters from the Atlantic. Mercury and PCB levels have been relatively high, although the Finnish Food Safety Authority considers the herring edible. Although the levels exceed the limits, the fatty acids have health benefits that offset this risk.\n\nRivers\n\n*Kemijoki\n*Kokem\u00e4enjoki\n*Oulujoki\n*Dal\u00e4lven\n*Ljusnan\n*Ljungan\n*Indals\u00e4lven\n*\u00c5ngerman River\n*Ume River\n*Skellefte River\n*Pite River\n*Lule River\n*Kalix River\n*Torne River\n\nCities\n\n*Oulu\n*Pori\n*Rauma\n*Vaasa\n*Lule\u00e5\n*Ume\u00e5\n*H\u00e4rn\u00f6sand\n*Sundsvall\n*G\u00e4vle\n*Jakobstad\nQuestion:\nWhere is the Gulf of Bothnia?\nAnswer:\nMare Suevicum\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nDeath to Spies\nReleased in 2007, Death to Spies () is a stealth third-person shooter PC game set in World War II and produced by 1C Company and Haggard Games. The game was released on Valve's digital distribution system, Steam, on March 12, 2008.\n\nGameplay\n\nDeath to Spies takes place from a third-person perspective. The player controls Semion Strogov, a captain in a Soviet counterintelligence agency named SMERSH. Strogov is able to run, jump, crouch, crawl and climb over obstacles, and he is also able to drive vehicles. Taking place in World War II, the player is required to complete various tasks in enemy territory, such as killing targets and stealing documents. Emphasis is placed on stealth, as the player is greatly outnumbered by enemy personnel, and some missions will be failed if the alarm is raised. \n\nThe game's missions are connected by cutscenes, taking place in 1951. After the arrest of the head of SMERSH Viktor Abakumov, Semion Strogov is questioned about his involvement in a number of special operations between 1943 through 1946, as his interrogators search for any connections between him and Abakumov.\n\nThe Heads-up display shows the level of awareness and suspicion of enemies, both of which are represented with a single bar at the top of the screen and are represented separately as different icons. A vector map can be displayed on the screen, showing characters' locations and their fields of vision, in which the player will be detected either instantly or gradually, depending on the distance. The vector map also shows the radius of noises made by the player; if someone is within the radius of the noise, they may investigate the noise or become alerted, depending on the noise.\n\nDisguises can be used to avoid alerting enemies when seen. When a character is knocked unconscious or killed without damaging the uniform, Strogov can change into their clothes. Some enemies are able to see through disguises and can be alerted if the player enters their vision, and all enemies can be alerted to suspicious behaviour which includes picking the lock of a door or looking through a door's keyhole, being in certain stances or having certain weapons visible.\n\nBefore starting a mission, the player is usually able to select equipment to bring to the mission. Strogov has a carrying capacity limited to one handgun, one long gun and 18 slots for small items such as ammunition and knives; one knife can also be stored in a dedicated slot. A backpack has space for larger items such as pliers and dynamite, and space for small items, but Strogov also has a weight limit to his inventory, and small items stored in a backpack must be moved to the 18 slots before it can be used.\nA variety of firearms (along with ammunition) and explosives are available to choose from, with the choices available depending on the mission. Other weapons include chloroform, knives, a garrote and poison. German equipment can also be chosen to avoid suspicion from enemy personnel when in disguise and/or to make use of ammunition taken from enemies' bodies.\n\nSeveral missions take place in allied areas. The player is forced to begin these missions lightly armed and they cannot select their equipment. However, weapons and ammunition can be found in the level.\n\nReception\n\nDeath to Spies mostly received above average reviews. The game has an average score of 70% on Game Rankings  and 69% on Metacritic.  GameSpot gave it a 7.0, praising its detailed level design variation and challenging missions, but at the same time noting that the game can be overly difficult at times. IGN gave it an 8.0, saying it was \"horrifically difficult at times and not without its peculiarities; Death to Spies is nevertheless always interesting and wholly addictive.\" \n\nSequel\n\nOn March 23, 2009 1C Company announced a sequel, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth.  It was released on August 10, 2009.\nQuestion:\nWhich counter-intelligence agency had a name meaning \u2018death to spies\u2019 in English?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",

A 2002 article in the Village Voice by Ed Park said he might have been English by birth but was more probably American. The article said he might have served in the navy and that he has been incorrectly called a graduate of MIT. The article says that he attended a vocational high school attached to MIT in 1888 but there is no record that he graduated. Park said rumors that Wright died within hours of Gadsby being published are untrue. \n\nIn October 1930 Wright approached the Evening Independent newspaper and proposed it sponsor a blue lipogram writing competition, with $250 for the winner. In the letter, he boasted of the quality of Gadsby. The newspaper declined his offer. \n\nA 2007 post on the Bookride blog about rare books says Wright spent five and a half months writing Gadsby on a typewriter with the \"e\" key tied down. According to the unsigned entry at Bookride, a warehouse holding copies of Gadsby burned shortly after the book was printed, destroying \"most copies of the ill fated novel.\" The blog post says the book was never reviewed \"and only kept alive by the efforts of a few avant garde French intellos and assorted connoisseurs of the odd, weird and zany.\" The book's scarcity and oddness has seen copies priced at $4,000 by book dealers.[http://www.bookride.com/2007/02/gadsby-story-of-over-50000-words_24.html   Bookride blog] February 24, 2007.\n\nWright completed a draft of Gadsby in 1936, during a nearly six month stint at the National Military Home in California. He failed to find a publisher and used a self-publishing press to bring out the book.\n\nWright previously authored three other books: The Wonderful Fairies of the Sun (1896), The Fairies That Run the World and How They Do It (1903), and Thoughts and Reveries of an American Bluejacket (1918). His humorous poem, \"When Father Carves the Duck\", can be found in some anthologies.\nQuestion:\n\"Ernest Vincent Wright wrote a novel, \"\"Gadsby\"\", which contains over 50,000 words -- none of them with which letter?\"\nAnswer:\n\u24a0\nPassage:\nWilliam Holman Hunt\nWilliam Holman Hunt  (2 April 1827 \u2013 7 September 1910) was an English painter and one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.  His paintings were notable for their great attention to detail, vivid color, and elaborate symbolism.  These features were influenced by the writings of John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle, according to whom the world itself should be read as a system of visual signs.  For Hunt it was the duty of the artist to reveal the correspondence between sign and fact.  Of all the members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Hunt remained most true to their ideals throughout his career.  He was always keen to maximize the popular appeal and public visibility of his works. \n\nBiography\n\nWilliam Holman Hunt changed his middle name from \"Hobman\" to Holman when he discovered that a clerk had misspelled the name after his baptism at the church of Saint Mary the Virgin, Ewell.  After eventually entering the Royal Academy art schools, having initially been rejected, Hunt rebelled against the influence of its founder Sir Joshua Reynolds. He formed the Pre-Raphaelite movement in 1848, after meeting the poet and artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Along with John Everett Millais they sought to revitalise art by emphasising the detailed observation of the natural world in a spirit of quasi-religious devotion to truth. This religious approach was influenced by the spiritual qualities of medieval art, in opposition to the alleged rationalism of the Renaissance embodied by Raphael. He had many pupils including Robert Braithwaite Martineau.\n\nHunt married twice. After a failed engagement to his model Annie Miller, he married Fanny Waugh, who later modelled for the figure of Isabella. When she died in childbirth in Italy he sculpted her tomb at Fiesole, having it brought down to the English Cemetery, beside the tomb of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. He had a close connection with St. Mark's Church in Florence, and paid for a communion chalice inscribed in the memory of his wife. His second wife, Edith, was Fanny's sister. At this time it was illegal in Britain to marry one's deceased wife's sister, so Hunt was forced to travel abroad to marry her. This led to a serious breach with other family members, notably his former Pre-Raphaelite colleague Thomas Woolner, who had once been in love with Fanny and had married Alice, the third sister of Fanny and Edith.\n\nHunt's works were not initially successful, and were widely attacked in the art press for their alleged clumsiness and ugliness. He achieved some early note for his intensely naturalistic scenes of modern rural and urban life, such as The Hireling Shepherd and The Awakening Conscience. However, it was with his religious paintings that he became famous, initially The Light of the World (1851\u20131853), now in the chapel at Keble College, Oxford; a later version (1900) toured the world and now has its home in St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nIn the mid-1850s Hunt travelled to the Holy Land in search of accurate topographical and ethnographical material for further religious works, and to \u201cuse my powers to make more tangible Jesus Christ\u2019s history and teaching\u201d;  there he painted The Scapegoat, The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple and The Shadow of Death, along with many landscapes of the region. Hunt also painted many works based on poems, such as Isabella and The Lady of Shalott. He eventually built his own house in Jerusalem \n\nHe eventually had to give up painting because failing eyesight meant that he could not get the level of quality that he wanted. His last major works, a large version of The Light of the World were completed with the help of his assistant Edward Robert Hughes.\n\nHunt died on 7 September 1910 and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral \n\nAwards and commemoration\n\nHunt published an autobiography in 1905.  Many of his late writings are attempts to control the interpretation of his work. That year, he was appointed to the Order of Merit by King Edward VII. At the end of his life he lived in Sonning-on-Thames.\n\nHis personal life was the subject of Diana Holman-Hunt's book My Grandfather, his Life and Loves. \n\nThe Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was depicted in two BBC period dramas. The first, The Love School, in 1975, starred Bernard Lloyd as Hunt. The second was Desperate Romantics, in which Hunt is played by Rafe Spall. \n\nFacing Mar Elias Monastery is a stone bench erected by the wife of the painter, who painted some of his major works at this spot. The bench is inscribed with biblical verses in Hebrew, Greek, Arabic and English.\n\nPartial list of works\n\n*A Converted British Family Sheltering a Christian Missionary from the Persecution of the Druids (1850)\n*Valentine Rescuing Sylvia from Proteus (1851)\n*The Awakening Conscience (1853)\n*The Light of the World (1854)\n*The Scapegoat (1856)\n*The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple (1860)\n*The Shadow of Death (1871)\n*The Importunate Neighbour (1895)\n*The Miracle of the Holy Fire (1899)\n\nGallery\n\nFile:William Holman Hunt - Christ and the two Marys - Google Art Project.jpg|Christ and the two Marys (1847 & 1897)\nFile:William Holman Hunt 001.jpg|The Hireling Shepherd (1851)\nFile:William Holman Hunt - The Lantern Maker's Courtship, A Street Scene in Cairo - Google Art Project.jpg| The Lantern Maker's Courtship, A Street Scene in Cairo (1854\u201356)\nFile:William Holman Hunt - Portrait of Fanny Holman Hunt.jpg|Portrait of Fanny Holman Hunt, (1866\u201367)\nFile:Basilpot.jpg| Isabella and the Pot of Basil (1868)\nFile:William Holman Hunt - The Birthday.jpg| The Birthday (1868)\nFile:William Holman Hunt - Amaryllis.jpg|Amaryllis (1884)\n\nFile:Holman-Hunt, William, and Hughes, Edward Robert - The Lady of Shalott - 1905.jpg| The Lady of Shalott (1905)\nQuestion:\nWhat is the title of the painting by William Holman Hunt which features an animal with a red cloth wrapped around its horns on the Day of Atonement?\nAnswer:\nThe Scapegoat (film)\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nKing George II - Britroyals.com\nKing George II | Britroyals\nBorn: October 30, 1683 at  Herrenhausen, Hanover\nParents: George I and Sophia Dorothea\nRelation to Elizabeth II: 5th great-grandfather\nHouse of: Hanover\nAscended to the throne: June 11, 1727 aged 43 years\nCrowned: October 11, 1727 at  Westminster Abbey\nMarried: Caroline, daughter of Margrave of Brandenburg\nChildren: Four sons and five daughters\nDied: October 25, 1760 at  Kensington Palace, aged 76 years, 11 months,  and 25 days\nBuried at: Westminster\nReigned for: 33 years, 4 months,  and 15 days\nSucceeded by: his grandson George III\nGeorge II was born in Hanover the son of George I and Sophia of Celle.
