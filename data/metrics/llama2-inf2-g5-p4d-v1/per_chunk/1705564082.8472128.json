The National Trust for Scotland owns the cave as part of a National Nature Reserve.  It became known as Fingal's Cave after the eponymous hero of an epic poem by 18th-century Scots poet-historian James Macpherson.\n\nFormation \n\nFingal's Cave is formed entirely from hexagonally jointed basalt columns within a Paleocene lava flow,  similar in structure to the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland and those of nearby Ulva.\n\nIn all these cases, cooling on the upper and lower surfaces of the solidified lava resulted in contraction and fracturing, starting in a blocky tetragonal pattern and transitioning to a regular hexagonal fracture pattern with fractures perpendicular to the cooling surfaces.  As cooling continued these cracks gradually extended toward the centre of the flow, forming the long hexagonal columns we see in the wave-eroded cross-section today.  Similar hexagonal fracture patterns are found in desiccation cracks in mud where contraction is due to loss of water instead of cooling. \n\nAcoustics \n\nThe cave's size and naturally arched roof,  and the eerie sounds produced by the echoes of waves, give it the atmosphere of a natural cathedral. The cave's Gaelic name, An Uaimh Bhinn, means \"the melodious cave.\"\n\nHistory \n\nLittle is known of the early history of Staffa, although the Swiss town of St\u00e4fa on Lake Zurich was named after the island by a monk from nearby Iona. Part of the Ulva estate of the Clan MacQuarrie from an early date until 1777,Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 124 the cave was brought to the attention of the English-speaking world by 18th-century naturalist Sir Joseph Banks in 1772.  \n\nIt became known as Fingal's Cave after the eponymous hero of an epic poem by 18th century Scots poet-historian James Macpherson. It formed part of his Ossian cycle of poems claimed to have been based on old Scottish Gaelic poems. In Irish mythology, the hero Fingal is known as Fionn mac Cumhaill, and it is suggested that Macpherson rendered the name as Fingal (meaning \"white stranger\" ) through a misapprehension of the name which in old Gaelic would appear as Finn.  The legend of the Giant's Causeway has Fionn or Finn building the causeway between Ireland and Scotland.[http://giantcrystals.strahlen.org/europe/basalt.htm Formation of basalt columns / pseudocrystals]\n\nSightseeing \n\nThe cave has a large arched entrance and is filled by the sea. Several sightseeing cruises organised from April to September by local companies pass the entrance to the cave. It is also possible to land elsewhere on the island (as some of these cruises permit) and walk overland to the cave, where a row of fractured columns forms a walkway just above high-water level permitting exploration on foot. From the inside, the entrance seems to frame the island of Iona across the water.\n\nIn art and literature \n\nRomantic composer Felix Mendelssohn visited in 1829 and wrote an overture, The Hebrides, Op. 26, (also known as Fingal's Cave overture), inspired by the weird echoes in the cave.  Mendelssohn's overture popularized the cave as a tourist destination. Other famous 19th-century visitors included author Jules Verne, who used it in his book Le Rayon vert (The Green Ray), and mentions it in the novels Journey to the Center of the Earth and The Mysterious Island; poets William Wordsworth, John Keats, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson; and Romantic artist J. M. W. Turner, who painted \"Staffa, Fingal's Cave\" in 1832.  Queen Victoria also made the trip.\n\nThe playwright August Strindberg also set scenes from his play A Dream Play in a place called \"Fingal's Grotto\". Scots novelist Sir Walter Scott described Fingal's Cave as \"one of the most extraordinary places I ever beheld. It exceeded, in my mind, every description I had heard of it... composed entirely of basaltic pillars as high as the roof of a cathedral, and running deep into the rock, eternally swept by a deep and swelling sea, and paved, as it were, with ruddy marble, [it] baffles all description.\" \n\nArtist Matthew Barney used the cave along with the Giant's Causeway for the opening and closing scenes of his art film, Cremaster 3. In 2008, the video artist Richard Ashrowan spent several days recording the interior of Fingal's Cave for an exhibition at the Foksal Gallery in Poland.\n\nOne of Pink Floyd's early songs bears this location's name. This instrumental was written for the film Zabriskie Point but not used. \n\nLloyd House at Caltech has a mural representing Fingal's Cave.  The hallway that features this mural also houses a wooden statue named Fingal, which is among the oldest heirlooms at the institute.\n\nScottish Celtic rock band Wolfstone recorded an instrumental titled \"Fingal's Cave\" on their 1999 album Seven.\n\nDimensions \n\n* Wood-Nuttall Encyclopaedia, 1907: 69\u00a0m (227\u00a0ft) deep, 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft) high. \n* National Public Radio: 45\u00a0m (150\u00a0ft) deep; 22\u00a0m (72\u00a0ft) high. \n* Show Caves of the World: 85\u00a0m (279\u00a0ft) deep; 23\u00a0m (75\u00a0ft) high.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nOn which Scottish island will you find Fingal\u2019s Cave?\nAnswer:\nStaffa\nPassage:\nAll my yesterdays; an autobiography (Book, 1973) [WorldCat ...\nAll my yesterdays; an autobiography (Book, 1973) [WorldCat.org]\nThe E-mail message field is required.

The canzone is famous as a showcase for tenors. Raffaele Mirate's performance of the bravura aria at the opera's 1851 premiere was hailed as the highlight of the evening. Before the opera's first public performance (in Venice), the song was rehearsed under tight secrecy:  a necessary precaution, as \"\" proved to be incredibly catchy, and soon after the song's first public performance, every gondolier in Venice was singing it.\n\nAs the opera progresses, the reprise of the tune in the following scenes exemplifies a sense of confusion, as Rigoletto realizes that from the sound of the Duke's lively voice coming from within the tavern (offstage), the body in the sack over which he had grimly triumphed, was not that of the Duke after all: Rigoletto had paid Sparafucile, an assassin, to kill the Duke, but Sparafucile had deceived Rigoletto by indiscriminately killing Gilda, Rigoletto's beloved daughter, instead. The song is an irony, as no character in the opera presents traits associated with rationality; every character may be considered callous and ' (\"inconstant\").\n\nThe music\n\nThe almost comical-sounding theme of \"\" is introduced immediately, and runs as illustrated (transposed from the original key of B major). The theme is repeated several times in the approximately two to three minutes it takes to perform the aria, but with the important\u2014and obvious\u2014omission of the last bar. This has the effect of driving the music forward as it creates the impression of being incomplete and unresolved, which it is, ending not on the tonic or dominant but on the submediant. Once the Duke has finished singing, however, the theme is once again repeated; but this time it includes the last, and conclusive, bar and finally resolving to the tonic. The song is strophic in form with an orchestral ritornello.\n\nLibretto\nQuestion:\n'La donna e mobile' is from which Verdi opera?\nAnswer:\nRigeletto\nPassage:\nAudi and Volvo - Latin origin of the car company names ...\nAudi and Volvo - Latin origin of the car company names - High Names\n03.20.13 Posted in Naming blog by christa\nLet\u2019s get back to the car business. We know a lot of the car companies are named after their founders \u2013 the trend was spread worldwide from the earliest electric automobiles. These include Ford (after Henry Ford), Peugeot (after the Peugeot family), also later Bentley (after Walter Owen Bentley), Porsche (after Ferdinand Porsche). The trend is also present in Asia by car manufacturers like Toyota (after Kiichiro Toyoda) and Honda (after Soichiro Honda).\nHowever, there are still original company names between the world-wide known brands in the car industry. The naming strategy is often so unique that they cannot be put in categories. But Audi and Volvo can. Can you guess what the connection between those two famous car companies is in terms of naming? Latin.\nVolvo \u2013 on the different car company names\nDespite that Volvo is a Swedish company the founders didn\u2019t name the car Viking or Nordic or anything like that. They decided on the Latin word volvere, meaning to roll. It seems a logical word choice since the purpose of working on a Swedish car project was to build cars that could withstand the cold Scandinavian weather and uneven roads \u2013 basically a car that rolls. What they did is only conjugate the verb volvere in first person (because unlike in English many other languages use similar but still different words when saying I roll, you roll, etc) and voil\u00e0 \u2013 you have Volvo. It\u2019s like the car speaks to you \u2013 I roll.\nAudi \u2013 on the translated car company names\nThe reason for naming the famous car company Audi\u00a0isn\u2019t that spontaneous compared to Volvo. The truth is that the founder August Horch (and no the AU in Audi doesn\u2019t come from the first two letters of the founder\u2019s name) had originally founded another car company named August Horch & Co. This happened in 1904 when the German engineer had quit working for Karl Benz. However, after some problems in the company, in 1909 Horch founded a second company \u2013 but his family name could not be used again as a name for the company because he didn\u2019t have the rights on the company name. The story says that one of his business partners\u2019 son came up with the name Audi. But this wasn\u2019t a random Latin word that simply starts with the letter A (as you may know by now from our blog posts having a company name that starts with A is great because you get listed early in alphabetically ordered lists). If you speak German you\u2019ll know that horch comes from the infinitive form of horchen and actually has a meaning \u2013 to listen (carefully). Now, can you guess what the Latin translation of horchen is? It\u2019s audire \u2013 a verb that when conjugated in the same form as horch, becomes audi. The name seemed logical since August Horch could no longer use his own name. And a little more than 100 years later Audi is still one of the most popular names in the car industry.\nQuestion:\nWhat car maker's name means 'roll' in Latin?\nAnswer:\nGlossary of Volvo features\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nNaismith Legacy Awards \u2014 Naismith.com\nNaismith Legacy Awards \u2014 Naismith.com\nGet in Touch\nWhat is the purpose of the Naismith Legacy Award?\nThe Naismith Legacy Award is presented to players, coaches and other individuals or organizations from the game of basketball honoring their role in furthering the values of Honor, Respect and Integrity, both on and off the court.

Dawson was often present at finds in the archaeological digs, or was the finder himself.\n\nBorn the eldest of three sons, Dawson moved with his family to Hastings, Sussex, when he was still very young. Charles initially studied as a lawyer following his father and pursued a hobby of collecting and studying fossils. He made a number of seemingly important fossil finds. Amongst these were teeth from a previously unknown species of mammal, later named Plagiaulax dawsoni in his honour; three new species of dinosaur, one later named Iguanodon dawsoni; and a new form of fossil plant, Salaginella dawsoni. The British Museum conferred upon him the title of Honorary Collector. For these important finds he was elected a fellow of the Geological Society and a few years later after another find, to the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1895. Dawson died prematurely from septicaemia in 1916.\n\nAlleged discoveries\n\nIn 1889 Dawson was a co-founder of the Hastings and St Leonards Museum Association, one of the first voluntary museum friends groups established in Britain. Dawson worked on a voluntary basis as a member of the Museum Committee, in charge of the acquisition of artefacts and documents. His interest in archaeology developed and he had an uncanny knack of making spectacular discoveries, The Sussex Daily News named him the \"Wizard of Sussex\" for his success.\n\nIn 1893 Dawson investigated a curious flint mine full of prehistoric, Roman and mediaeval artefacts at Lavant, near Chichester and probed in inner depths of two tunnels beneath Hastings Castle. In the same year he presented the British Museum with a Roman statuette from Beauport Park which was made, uniquely for the period, of cast iron. Other discoveries followed, including a strange form of hafted Neolithic stone axe and a well-preserved ancient timber boat.\n\nHe studied ancient quarries, reanalysed the Bayeux Tapestry and in 1909 produced what was then the definitive study of Hastings Castle. He later found faked evidence for the final phases of Roman occupation in Britain at Pevensey Castle in Sussex.  Investigating unusual elements of the natural world, Dawson found a toad petrified inside a flint nodule, discovered a large supply of natural gas at Heathfield in East Sussex, reported on a sea-serpent in the English Channel, observed a new species of human and found a strange goldfish/carp hybrid. It was even reported that he was experimenting with phosphorescent bullets as a deterrent to Zeppelin attacks on London.\n\nIn recognition of his many discoveries, Dawson was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries London in 1895. At the age of 31, and without a university degree to his name, he was now Charles Dawson F.G.S., F.S.A. His most famous discovery was in 1912 with the discovery of the Piltdown Man which was billed as the \"missing link\" between humans and other great apes.\n\nCriticism\n\nQuestions about the Piltdown find were raised from the beginning, first by Arthur Keith, but also by paleontologists and anatomists from the Smithsonian Institution and from Europe. Those disputing the find were attacked in very personal terms. Challenges to Piltdown Man arose again in the 1920s, but were again dismissed. In 1949, further questions were raised about the Piltdown Man and its authenticity, which led to Piltdown being conclusively proven a hoax in 1953. Since then a number of Dawson's other finds have also been proven to be fakes or planted.  \n\nIn 2003, Dr. Miles Russell of Bournemouth University published the results of his investigation into Dawson's antiquarian collection and concluded that at least 38 specimens were clear fakes. Russell has noted that Dawson\u2019s whole academic career appears to have been \"one built upon deceit, sleight of hand, fraud and deception, the ultimate gain being international recognition\".\n\nCharles Dawson never received a knighthood, though many others associated with the Piltdown \"find\" did, and was never elected to the Royal Society. Following his death in 1916, no further finds were made at Piltdown.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name given to the 'Missing Link' which Charles Dawson claimed to have discovered in a gravel pit in Sussex in 1912?\nAnswer:\nPiltdown Man\nPassage:\nThe Confession of Isobel Gowdie\nThe Confession of Isobel Gowdie is a work for large symphony orchestra by the Scottish composer James MacMillan.\n\nIt is, according to the composer, a Requiem for one Isobel Gowdie, supposedly burnt as a witch in post-Reformation Scotland. Despite the work's depiction of the violent torture and execution of Gowdie, it is actually thought that no torture took place prior to her confession.\n\nIt was written in 1990 and premiered at that year's Proms concerts in London. It was an instant success, receiving, according to the critic Stephen Johnson, \"an ovation the like of which had rarely been seen at a British premiere since the death of Benjamin Britten\". \n\nThe work falls into three major sections: an opening, elegiac string section, followed by a violent middle part (according to Johnson, redolent of \"trial, torture or mass hysteria\") followed by a return to the more subdued atmosphere of the opening for strings, but this time punctuated by violent outbursts from the full orchestra. It resolves on one note, in a massive crescendo to fffff which bears the hallmark of a similar motif in Alban Berg's Wozzeck.\n\nThe work was premiered by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, under Jerzy Maksymiuk, who later recorded it. It has been performed and recorded many times since, including repeat performances by the BBC SSO, and the RSAMD Symphony Orchestra in the composer's 50th birthday celebrations.\n\nInstrumentation \n\nThe Confession of Isobel Gowdie is scored for the following orchestra: \n\n8 Woodwinds\n* 2 Flutes (2nd doubling Piccolo)\n* 2 Oboes (2nd doubling Cor Anglais)\n* 2 Clarinets in B\u266d (2nd doubling Bass Clarinet)\n* 2 Bassoons (2nd doubling Contrabassoon)\n11 Brass\n* 4 Horns in F\n* 3 Trumpets in C\n* 2 Trombones\n* Bass Trombone\n* Tuba\nTimpani\n\n2 Percussion\n# 2 Congas (high, low), 2 Timbales (high, low), Xylophone, 3 Tam-tams (small, medium, large), Anvil, Tubular bells\n# Snare drum, 2 Congas (high, low), Vibraphone, Bass drum, very large tam-tam\n* (The 2  players are to be as far apart as possible to enhance the antiphonal effects.)\nStrings\nQuestion:\nName the contemporary Scottish composer whose works include The Confession of Isobel Gowdie and Vent, Veni Emmanuel written for the percussionist Evelyn Glennie?\nAnswer:\nJames MacMillan (musician)\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nLondon 2012 Summer Olympics - results & video highlights\nLondon 2012 Summer Olympics - results & video highlights\nOfficial Reports arrow\nThe London 2012 Games were centred around the Olympic Park in east London, which is the site of a number of new sports venues.

It consists of six equal horizontal bands of black (top), yellow, red, black, yellow, and red (bottom); a white disc is superimposed at the centre and depicts the national symbol, a grey crowned crane, facing the hoist side. \n\nDuring the colonial era the British used a British Blue ensign defaced with the colonial badge, as prescribed in 1865 regulations. Buganda, the largest of the traditional kingdoms in the colony of Uganda, had its own flag.   However, in order to avoid appearing to give preference to one region of the colony over any other, the British colonial authorities selected the crane emblem for use on the Blue ensign and other official banners.  \n\nHistory\n\nWhen the Democratic Party ruled the country, a design for flag was proposed. It had vertical stripes of green-blue-green, separated by narrower yellow stripes, and in the centre had the silhouette of a yellow crane. After the party lost the national elections on April 25, 1962 the newly elected Uganda People\u2019s Congress (UPC) rejected the former design and instead proposed the current design. It was based on the flag of UPC\u2013 a tricolor having horizontal strips of red, yellow and black. The British administration gave their approval to this design before the country's independence. The flag was designed by the Ugandan Minister of Justice, Grace Ibingira.\n\nSymbolism\n\nThe three colours are representative of African peoples (black), Africa's sunshine (yellow), and African brotherhood (red being the colour of blood, through which all Africans are connected).   The grey crowned crane is fabled for its gentle nature and was also the military badge of Ugandan soldiers during British rule. The raised leg of the crane symbolizes the forward movement of the country.  \n\nOther flags\n\nFile:Flag of the Uganda Protectorate.svg|Flag of the Uganda Protectorate (1914-March, 1962)\nFile:Standard of the Governor of the Uganda Protectorate.svg|Standard of the Governor of Uganda (1914 - March, 1962)\nFile:Flag of Uganda 1962.svg|National flag (March - October 9, 1962) \nFile:Presidential Standard of Uganda.svg|Presidential Standard of Uganda\n\nSimilar Flags\nQuestion:\nWhat kind of bird appears on the flag of Uganda?\nAnswer:\nCrowned crane (disambiguation)\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nDonald's Nephews\nDonald's Nephews (1938) is a Donald Duck animated cartoon which features Donald being visited by his three nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. This cartoon is Huey, Dewey, and Louie's very first appearance in animation.   The short, and the three nephews, was the idea of Al Taliaferro, the artist for the Silly Symphonies comic strip, which featured Donald Duck. The Walt Disney Productions Story Dept. on February 5, 1937, sent Taliaferro a memo recognizing him as the source of the idea for the planned short.  Taliaferro subsequently introduced the nephews in his comic strip, which by this time had been renamed Donald Duck, on Sunday, October 17, 1937, beating the theatrical release of Donald's Nephews by almost six months. \n\nPlot\n\nDonald receives a postcard from his sister, Dumbella, which says that her three boys, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, are coming to visit him. At first Donald is excited to see his nephews, but soon the boys start causing problems, being a constant annoyance to their uncle.\n\nDonald consults a book entitled Modern Child Training, and tries to use the suggestions to gain control over his nephews, but things only get worse. In the end, after the boys leave and with his house left almost destroyed, Donald spots a page which reads \"After all, little children are only angels without wings\". This so enrages Donald that he rips the book to pieces and explodes.\n\nNephews Antics\n\nThroughout the cartoon, Huey, Dewey, and Louie play tricks on their Uncle Donald in order to annoy him. They cause extensive damage throughout his house, and have fun at Donald's expense. Some of their activities include:\n* Playing croquet on tricycles in Donald's living room, breaking vases, lamps, and windows\n* As Donald plays the piano to try to calm his nephews, the boys pick up instruments to play along with him, however Dewey uses his trombone to launch an apple at Donald, and Huey uses his cello to project his bow at Donald\n* While Donald plays the piano, Huey fills a bag with water, and Louie bursts it with his slingshot\n* Giving Donald a pie full of scorching hot mustard, then, to cool him down, they throw water on him and spray him in the face with a fire extinguisher, then throw his book at him and ride away on their tricycles\n\nAvailability\n\n* Walt Disney's Funny Factory With Huey Dewey & Louie Vol. 4\nQuestion:\nWhat are the names of Donald Duck's three nephews?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",

It was adapted into a television mini-series starring John Thaw and Lindsay Duncan. Reviewers praised the book's honest style, wit[http://french.about.com/library/reviews/aafpr-yearinprovence.htm A Year in Provence, by Peter Mayle] and its refreshing humour.  The book was turned into an equally popular radio version.\n\nPlot\n\nPeter Mayle and his wife move to Provence, and are soon met with unexpectedly fierce weather, underground truffle dealers and unruly workers, who work around their normalement schedule.  Meals in Proven\u00e7al restaurants and work on the Mayles' house, garden and vineyard are features of the book, whose chapters follow the months of the year.\n\nMini-series\n\nIn 1993, the BBC produced a television mini-series based on the book, starring Lindsay Duncan and John Thaw, with appearances from Alfred Molina and James Fleet amongst others. Unlike the book, the miniseries was\nnot well received by critics; A Year in Provence was later placed at number ten on a Radio Times list of \nthe worst television programs ever made   \n  with the writer, John Naughton, describing\nit as the \"\"smugathon\" series A Year In Provence \" and stated it \"achieved the near impossible - creating a John Thaw vehicle nobody liked\".\nQuestion:\nIn the television programme 'A Year In Provence', which actress played the part of Peter Mayle's wife?\nAnswer:\nLindsay Vere Duncan\nPassage:\nEast Lyn River\nThe East Lyn is a river which rises high in Exmoor, in the English county of Somerset. It flows through the East Lyn Valley in Devon.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Lynmouth Disaster occurred on the East Lyn river  due to rocks and fallen trees having been washed into the West Lyn river. These formed a log jam near Watersmeet, forming a landslide dam. When the pressure behind the dam increased to uncontrollable levels, the water broke out of the dam, and rushed down the East Lyn (via the convergence of the rivers) into Lynmouth, obliterating houses and ultimately resulting in 34 deaths. Boulders from the incident can still be seen today, lining the banks of the East Lyn as it travels into Lynmouth today.\n\nWatercourse\n\nThe river is formed as the Upper East Lyn at Malmsmead from two minor tributaries, the Oare Water and Badgworthy Water. It flows for several miles, past Brendon and makes confluence with Hoar Oak Water at Watersmeet, where Watersmeet House is situated.  The river then passes through a narrow gorge section, before flowing downstream for a further  until the river meets with the West Lyn River and flows into the Bristol Channel at Lynmouth. \n\nRecreation\n\nAngling\n\nAngling interests especially in the summer are targeted towards the salmon which migrate up the river to spawn. There is also trout fishing. \n\nWalking\n\nIt is popular for walkers with the Two Moors Way near to much of the river.\n\nWhitewater kayaking\n\nWhitewater kayakers frequently run this river in the winter when seeking a challenging Grade 4 paddle.\nQuestion:\nThe River Lyn is in which English county?\nAnswer:\nDevon, England\nPassage:\nJay Records - Therese Raquin\nJay Records - Therese Raquin\nJAY RECORDS\nBuy now from Jay Records\n$29.99\nA startling new musical adaptation of the classic French novel\u00a0\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin...by \u00c8mile Zola\nMusic by Craig Adams\nBook & Lyrics by Nona Shepphard\n1860s Paris.\u00a0In a small dusty haberdasher\u2019s shop near the Seine in the dank, narrow Passage du Pont Neuf, the young and beautiful Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin is trapped in a loveless marriage to her sickly cousin, Camille.
