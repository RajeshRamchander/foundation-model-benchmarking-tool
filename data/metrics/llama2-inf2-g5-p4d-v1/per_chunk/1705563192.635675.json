It was developed in 18th-century Britain by Richard Arkwright and John Kay.\n\nHistorical context\n\nIn 1760 England, yarn production from wool, flax and cotton was still a cottage industry in which fibres were carded and spun by hand using a spinning wheel.  As the textile industry expanded its markets and adopted faster machines, yarn supplies became scarce especially due to innovations such as the doubling of the loom speed after the invention of the flying shuttle.  High demand for yarn spurred invention of the spinning jenny in 1764, followed closely by the invention of the spinning frame, later developed into the water frame (patented in 1769).  Mechanisms had increased production of yarn so dramatically that by 1830 the yarn cottage industry in England could no longer compete and all spinning was carried out in factories. \n\nDevelopment\n\nRichard Arkwright employed John Kay to produce a new spinning machine that Kay had worked on with (or possibly stolen from) another inventor called Thomas Highs.   With the help of other local craftsmen the team produced the spinning frame, which produced a stronger thread than the spinning jenny produced by James Hargreaves.  The frame employed the draw rollers invented by Lewis Paul to stretch, or attenuate, the yarn.  \n\nThe roller spinning process starts with a thick 'string' of lose fibers called a roving, which is passed between three pairs of rollers, each pair rotating slightly faster than the previous one. In this way it is reduced in thickness and increased in length before a strengthening twist is added by a bobbin-and-flyer mechanism.  The spacing of the rollers has to be slightly greater than the fiber length to prevent breakage. The nip of the roller pairs prevent the twist from backing up to the roving.\n\nToo large to be operated by hand, the spinning frame needed a new source of power.  Arkwright at first experimented with horses, but decided to employ the power of the water wheel, which gave the invention the name 'water frame'.  \n\nFor some time, the stronger yarn produced by the spinning frame was used in looms for the lengthwise \"warp\" threads that bound cloth together, while hand powered jennies provided the weaker yarn used for the horizontal filler \"weft\" threads.  The jennies required skill but was inexpensive and could be used in a home.  The spinning frames required significant capital but required little skill.\nQuestion:\nWhich English inventor was responsible for the introduction of the multi-spool spinning frame known as the Spinning Jenny in1764?\nAnswer:\nJAMES HARGREAVES\nPassage:\nRide of the Valkyries\nThe \"Ride of the Valkyries\" () is the popular term for the beginning of act 3 of Die Walk\u00fcre, the second of the four operas by Richard Wagner that constitute Der Ring des Nibelungen.\n\nAs a separate piece, the \"Ride\" is often heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes. Together with the \"Bridal Chorus\" from Lohengrin, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" is one of Wagner's best-known pieces.\n\nContext \n\nIn the Walk\u00fcre opera, the \"Ride\", which takes around eight minutes, begins in the prelude to the third act, building up successive layers of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal a mountain peak where four of the eight Valkyrie sisters of Br\u00fcnnhilde have gathered in preparation for the transportation of fallen heroes to Valhalla. As they are joined by the other four, the familiar tune is carried by the orchestra, while, above it, the Valkyries greet each other and sing their battle-cry. Apart from the song of the Rhinemaidens in Das Rheingold, it is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner's Ring cycle.\n\nPerformance history \n\nThe complete opera Die Walk\u00fcre was first performed on 26 June 1870 in the National Theatre Munich against the composer's intent. By January of the next year, Wagner was receiving requests for the \"Ride\" to be performed separately, but wrote that such a performance should be considered \"an utter indiscretion\" and forbade \"any such thing\".  However, the piece was still printed and sold in Leipzig, and Wagner subsequently wrote a complaint to the publisher Schott.  In the period up to the first performance of the complete Ring cycle, Wagner continued to receive requests for separate performances, his second wife Cosima noting \"Unsavoury letters arrive for R. \u2013 requests for the Ride of the Valkyries and I don't know what else.\"  Once the Ring had been given in Bayreuth in 1876, Wagner lifted the embargo. He himself conducted it in London on 12 May 1877, repeating it as an encore. \n\nOutside opera \n\nIn film \n\nUses in film include the original score for The Birth of a Nation (1915),  and What's Opera, Doc? (1957). \n\nThe \"Ride\" is also associated with Apocalypse Now (1979),  where the 1/9 Air Cavalry regiment plays the piece of music on helicopter-mounted loudspeakers during their assault on a Vietnamese village as psychological warfare and to motivate their own troops. \n\nIn military \n\nThe \"Ride\" is the regimental quick march of the British Parachute Regiment. \n\nIn music \n\nWithin the concert repertoire, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" remains a popular encore, especially when other Wagnerian extracts feature in the scheduled program. For example, at the BBC Proms it was performed as such by Klaus Tennstedt and the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 6 August 1992  and also by Valery Gergiev with the Kirov Orchestra on 28 August 2001. \n\nDiscography \n\nApart from where the \"Ride\" is included in the recordings of the Walk\u00fcre opera, it is a very popular piece, included in various popular classics anthologies. For instance in Deutsche Grammophon's 1991 Classicmania two CD album (von Karajan version), and in Brilliant Classics' 2011 Best Film Classics CD box, there included in the fifth CD, Opera at the Movies, with a reference to Apocalypse Now on the sleeve.\nQuestion:\n'The Ride of the Valkyries' was composed by who?\nAnswer:\nWagner's\nPassage:\nChicago-style pizza\nChicago-style pizza refers to several different styles of pizza developed in Chicago. Arguably, the most famous of these is known as deep-dish pizza. The pan in which it is baked gives the pizza its characteristically high edge and a deep surface for large amounts of cheese and a chunky tomato sauce. Chicago-style pizza may be prepared in deep-dish style and as a stuffed pizza.  \n\nStyles\n\nDeep-dish pizza\n\nAccording to Tim Samuelson, Chicago's official cultural historian, there is not enough documentation to determine with certainty who invented Chicago-style deep-dish pizza.  It is often reported that Chicago-style deep-dish pizza was invented at Pizzeria Uno in Chicago, in 1943,[http://members.cox.net/jjschnebel/ddishpiz.html Who Cooked That Up?] by Uno's founder Ike Sewell, a former University of Texas football star. However, a 1956 article from the Chicago Daily News asserts that Uno's original pizza chef Rudy Malnati developed the recipe. \n\nThe primary difference between deep-dish pizza and most other forms of pizza is that, as the name suggests, the crust is very deep, creating a very thick pizza that resembles a pie more than a flatbread. Although the entire pizza is very thick, in traditional Chicago-style deep-dish pizzas, the crust itself is thin to medium in thickness.\n\nDeep-dish pizza is baked in a round, steel pan that is more similar to a cake or pie pan than a typical pizza pan. The pan is oiled in order to allow for easy removal as well as to create a fried effect on the outside of the crust. In addition to ordinary wheat flour, the pizza dough may contain corn meal, semolina, or food coloring, giving the crust a distinctly yellowish tone. The dough is pressed up onto the sides of the pan, forming a bowl for a very thick layer of toppings.\n\nThe thick layer of toppings used in deep-dish pizza requires a longer baking time, which could burn cheese or other toppings if they were used as the top layer of the pizza. Because of this, the toppings are assembled \"upside-down\" from their usual order on a pizza. The crust is covered with cheese (generally sliced mozzarella), followed by various meat options such as pepperoni or sausage, the latter of which is sometimes in a solid patty-like layer. Other toppings such as onions, mushrooms and bell peppers are then also used. An uncooked sauce, typically made from crushed canned tomatoes, is added as the finishing layer; though sometimes, a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese is added for extra flavor. It is typical that when ordered for carry-out or delivery, the pizza is uncut, as this prevents the oils from soaking into the crust, causing the pie to become soggy.\n\nSome Chicago deep-dish pizza restaurants ship their partially baked pizzas within the continental U.S. \n\nFile:Pizzeria Uno Chicago-style deep-dish pizza.jpg |Deep-dish pizza from the original Pizzeria Uno location\nFile:Chicago-style-pizza-03.jpg |Deep-dish pizza from Lou Malnati's\nFile:Kitchen 17 Vegan Sausage Deep Dish.jpg |Deep-dish pizza from vegan restaurant Kitchen 17 in Chicago\n\nStuffed pizza\n\nBy the mid-1970s, two Chicago chains, Nancy's Pizza, founded by Rocco Palese, and Giordano's Pizzeria, operated by brothers Efren and Joseph Boglio, began experimenting with deep dish pizza and created the stuffed pizza.  Palese based his creation on his mother's recipe for scarciedda, an Italian Easter pie from his hometown of Potenza.  Chicago Magazine articles featuring Nancy's Pizza and Giordano's stuffed pizza popularized the dish.\n\nStuffed pizzas are often even deeper than deep-dish pizzas, but otherwise, it can be hard to see the difference until it is cut into. A stuffed pizza generally has much deeper topping density than any other type of pizza. As with deep-dish pizza, a deep layer of dough forms a bowl in a high-sided pan and the toppings and cheese are added. Then, an additional layer of dough goes on top and is pressed to the sides of the crust.\n\nAt this stage, the thin dough top has a rounded, domed appearance. Pizza makers often poke a small hole in the top of the \"lid\" to allow air and steam to escape while cooking, so that the pizza does not explode. Usually, but not always, tomato sauce is ladled over the top crust before the pizza is baked.\n\nThin-crust pizza\n\nThere is also a style of thin-crust pizza found in Chicago and throughout the rest of the Midwest. The crust is thin and firm enough to have a noticeable crunch, unlike a New York-style pizza. This pizza is cut into squares, also known as party cut or tavern cut,  as opposed to a pie cut into wedges. Aurelios is a chain which specializes in this kind of pizza. Casa Bianca,  located in the Eagle Rock section of Los Angeles, is also well known for this style of thin-crusted Chicago bar pizza.[http://www.laweekly.com/2009-07-02/eat-drink/first-date-italian-style/ Celestino: First Date, Italian-Style - Page 1 - Eat+Drink - Los Angeles - LA Weekly][http://extratv.warnerbros.com/2008/11/baracks_favorite_pizzeria_head.php Where's Obama's Favorite Pizza? | ExtraTV.com][http://casabiancapizza.com/history.html Casa Bianaca Pizza (history)]\nQuestion:\nWhat type of pizza is Chicago known for?\nAnswer:\nDeep Dish (disambiguation)\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nGuillemot\nGuillemots is the common name for several species of seabird in the auk family (part of the order Charadriiformes).  In British use, the term comprises two genera: Uria and Cepphus. In North America the Uria species are called \"murres\" and only the Cepphus species are called \"guillemots\". This word of French origin apparently derives from a form of the name William, cf. . \n\nThe two living species of Uria, together with the razorbill, dovekie and the extinct great auk, make up the tribe Alcini.  They have distinctly white bellies, thicker and longer bills than Cepphus, and form very dense colonies on cliffs during the reproductive season. \n\nThe three living species of Cepphus form a tribe of their own: Cepphini.   They are smaller than the Uria species and have black bellies, rounder heads and bright red feet.\n\nIn July 2013, Dr Steven Portugal from the Royal Veterinary College demonstrated that when water touches the eggs, it forms into droplets rather than running off; in other words, guillemot eggs are water-repellant and self-cleaning.\n\nSystematics\n\nUria\n\n*Common murre or common guillemot, Uria aalge\n*Thick-billed murre or Br\u00fcnnich's guillemot, Uria lomvia\n\nSome prehistoric species are also known:\n\n* Uria bordkorbi (Monterey or Sisquoc Late Miocene of Lompoc, USA)\n* Uria affinis (Late Pleistocene of E USA)\u2014possibly a subspecies of U. lomvia\n* Uria paleohesperis\n\nU. brodkorbi is the only known occurrence of the Alcini tribe in the temperate to subtropical Pacific, except for the very fringe of the range of U. aalge.\n\nCepphus\n\n* Black guillemot or tystie,  Cepphus grylle\n* Pigeon guillemot,  Cepphus columba\n* Spectacled guillemot,  Cepphus carbo\n\nAs in other genera of auks, fossils of prehistoric forms of Cepphus have been found:\n\n* Cepphus olsoni (San Luis Rey River Late Miocene\u2014Early Pliocene of W USA)\n* Cepphus cf. columba (Lawrence Canyon Early Pliocene of W USA)\n* Cepphus cf. grylle (San Diego Late Pliocene, W USA)\n\nThe latter two resemble the extant species, but because of the considerable distance in time or space from their current occurrence, they may represent distinct species.\nQuestion:\nWhat kind of bird is a guillemot?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",

It is taken to represent the queen Cassiopeia of the mythical kingdom Ethiopia. In Greek mythology, Cassiopeia offended the Nereids (sea nymphs) by boasting about being more beautiful than them. As punishment for her vanity, she had to sacrifice her daughter Andromeda to appease the sea monster Cetus sent by Poseidon. It is said that, once placed in the sky, Cassiopeia was condemned to circle the celestial pole forever, sometimes hanging upside down, as additional punishment. The constellation is quite easy to spot in the sky because five of its bright stars form a distinctive 'W' shape.\nThe constellation Cassiopeia occupies an area of 598 square degrees and contains three stars with known planets. It can be seen at latitudes between +90\u00b0 and -20\u00b0 and is best visible at 9 p.m. during the month of November.\n[1959] beta Cassiopeiae or Caph (\"palm\") is a yellow-white giant with a magnitude of 2.28, classified as a Delta Scuti type variable. It is twice the size of the Sun and 28 times brighter.\n[1878] alpha Cassiopeiae, Shedir or Shedar (\"the breast\") has a magnitude of 2.25 and is the second brightest star in the constellation. It is an orange giant more than 500 times brighter than the Sun.\n[1880] gamma Cassiopeiae is the central star of the constellation. It is an eruptive variable star. It does not have a traditional Latin or Arabic name, but the Chinesse call it Tsih (\"the whip\"). At maximum intensity (currently 2.15), the star outshines both alpha and beta Cassiopeiae. Gamma Cassiopeiae spins very rapidly and bulges along the equator, which causes it to lose mass. As a result, a disk forms around the star which is responsible for the variations in brightness and emissions.\n[1881] delta Cassiopeiae, also known as Ksora or Ruchbah (\"knee\") is an eclipsing binary star about 99 light-years distant. It has an apparent visual magnitude that varies between 2.68 and 2.71.\n[1882] epsilon Cassiopeiae, also called Segin, is a blue-white giant about 442 light-years away from Earth. Its luminosity is 720 times that of the Sun.\n[1891] rho Cassiopeiae and V509 Cassiopeiae are among the most luminous stars visible to the naked eye in the galaxy. [1883] eta Cassiopeiae is a binary star consisting of a yellow dwarf similar to our Sun and an orange dwarf.\nCassiopeia also has two notable Messier objects, both open star clusters. Messier 52 or NGC 7654 was discovered by Charles Messier in 1774 and can be seen with binoculars. In stronger telescopes, it appears as a rich, V-shaped cluster of faint stars with a bright yellow star on the edge.\nMessier 103 or NGC 581 was the last Messier object to be catalogued by Charles Messier himself. At about 8,000 light-years away, it is one of the more remote open clusters to be catalogued. It contains between 40 and 50 stars, the brightest one of which is Struve 131 or HD 9311. The cluster is faint, but once found, it has the appearance of curving star chains streaming outward from the centre.\nTycho's Star or CN 1572, observed as a supernova in 1572 and documented by the Danish nobleman and astronomer Tycho Brahe, is also located in Cassiopeia. The star named Tycho G is being studied as a possible companion to the star that created the supernova. The other supernova remnant in the constellation is Cassiopeia A, the strongest radio source outside our solar system that can be observed. The cloud of material left over from the supernova is now about 10 light-years across.\nFinally, the constellation contains an irregular galaxy, IC 10, first discovered by Lewis Swift in 1887. It is somewhat difficult to study because, located near the Milky Way plane, it is obscured by interstellar matter. With an exceptionally high rate of star formation, however, IC 10 is known as the only starburst galaxy in the Local Group.\nQuestion:\nIn which constellation do the five main stars form a 'W' shape?\nAnswer:\nCassiepeia\nPassage:\nHysteria\nHysteria, in the colloquial use of the term, means ungovernable emotional excess. Generally, modern medical professionals have abandoned using the term \"hysteria\" to denote a diagnostic category, replacing it with more precisely defined categories, such as somatization disorder. In 1980, the American Psychiatric Association officially changed the diagnosis of \"hysterical neurosis, conversion type\" (the most extreme and effective type) to \"conversion disorder\".\n\nHistory\n\nFor at least 2,000 years of European history until the late 19th century, the term \"hysteria\" referred to a medical condition thought to be particular to women and caused by disturbances of the uterus (from the Greek \u1f51\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 hystera \"uterus\"), such as when a newborn child emerges from the birth canal. The origin of the term is commonly attributed to Hippocrates, even though it is not used in the writings that are collectively known as the Hippocratic corpus.  The Hippocratic corpus refers to a variety of illness symptoms \u2013 such as suffocation and Heracles' disease \u2013 which were supposedly caused by the movement of a woman's uterus to various locations within her body as it became light and dry due to a lack of bodily fluids. One passage recommends pregnancy to cure such symptoms, ostensibly because intercourse will \"moisten\" the womb and facilitate blood circulation within the body. The \"wandering womb\" theory persisted in European medicine for centuries.\n\nBy the mid- to late 19th century, hysteria (sometimes called female hysteria) had come to refer to what is today generally considered to be sexual dysfunction. Typical treatment was massage of the patient's genitalia by the physician and, later, by vibrators or water sprays to cause orgasm. A male counterpart of the diagnosis of hysteria, which then almost exclusively applied to women, was associated with symptoms now mostly considered to be signs of PTSD.\n\nA more modern understanding of hysteria as a psychological disorder was advanced by the work of Jean-Martin Charcot, a French neurologist. In his 1893 obituary of Charcot, Sigmund Freud attributed the rehabilitation of hysteria as a topic for scientific study to the positive attention generated by Charcot\u2019s neuropathological investigations of hysteria during the last ten years of his life., first published in  Freud questioned Charcot\u2019s claim that heredity is the unique cause of hysteria, but he lauded his innovative clinical use of hypnosis to demonstrate how hysterical paralysis could result from psychological factors produced by non-organic traumas (psychological factors that Charcot believed could be simulated using hypnosis). According to Freud, this discovery allowed subsequent investigators such as Pierre Janet and Josef Breuer to develop new theories of hysteria that were essentially similar to the medieval conception of split consciousness, but with the non-scientific terminology of demonic possession replaced with modern psychological concepts.\n\nIn the early 1890s Freud published a series of articles on hysteria which popularized Charcot's earlier work, and began the development of his own views on hysteria. By the 1920s Freud's theory on hysteria was influential in the UK and the US. Freudian psychoanalytic theory attributed hysterical symptoms to the unconscious mind's attempt to protect the patient from psychic stress. Unconscious motives include primary gain, in which the symptom directly relieves the stress (as when a patient coughs to release energy pent up from keeping a secret), and secondary gain, in which the symptom provides an independent advantage, such as staying at home away from a hated job. More recent critics have noted the possibility of tertiary gain, as when a patient is induced unconsciously to display a symptom because of the desires of others (for instance when a controlling spouse enjoys the docility of his or her sick partner).  \n\nJudith Herman suggests, in Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence: From Domestic Abuse to Political Terror,  that hysteria was a label given to a form of PTSD arising from routine domestic abuse of women, including physical abuse, rape, and emotional abuse. She describes the work of Charcot and Freud, which had resulted in Freud's finding in \"The Aetiology of Hysteria\" in 1896 (which he later repudiated):\n\n\"I therefore put forward the thesis that at the bottom of every case of hysteria there are  one or more occurrences of premature sexual experience ... \". \n\nCurrent theories and practices\n\nCurrent psychiatric terminology distinguishes two types of disorder that were previously labelled \"hysteria\": somatoform disorder and dissociative disorder. There are many cases of these disorders where nothing else can be diagnosed in the sufferers. The dissociative disorders in DSM-IV-TR include dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, dissociative identity disorder, depersonalization disorder, and dissociative disorder not otherwise specified. Somatoform disorders include conversion disorder, somatization disorder, pain disorder, hypochondriasis, and body dysmorphic disorder. In somatoform disorders, the patient exhibits physical symptoms, such as low back pain or limb paralysis, which have no  apparent physical cause. Additionally, certain culture-bound syndromes \u2013 such as \"ataques de nervios\" (\"attacks of nerves\") identified in Hispanic populations, and popularized by Pedro Almod\u00f3var's film Women on the Verge of a Nervous  Breakdown \u2013 exemplify psychiatric phenomena which encompass both somatoform and dissociative symptoms, and have been linked to psychological trauma.  Recent neuroscientific research is now beginning to show that there are characteristic patterns of brain activity associated with these states.  All these disorders are thought to be unconscious, not feigned and not intentional malingering.\n\nJungian psychologist Laurie Layton Schapira has explored the \"Cassandra Complex\" suffered by those traditionally diagnosed with hysteria.   Basing her findings on clinical experience, she delineates three factors which constitute the Cassandra Complex in hysterics: (a) dysfunctional relationships, with social manifestations of rationality, order and reason, leading to (b) emotional or physical suffering, particularly in the form of somatic, often gynaecological complaints, and\n(c) sufferers being disbelieved or dismissed when attempting to relate the facticity of these experiences to others.\n\nMass hysteria\n\nThe term also occurs in the phrase \"mass hysteria\" to describe mass public near-panic reactions. Hysteria was often associated with events such as the Salem witch trials, or slave revolt.\nQuestion:\nWhose Selected Papers on Hysteria, translated in 1909 by Abraham Brill, introduced the word libido into English?\nAnswer:\nZigi Frojd\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nstereophonics - dakota - YouTube\nstereophonics - dakota - YouTube\nstereophonics - dakota\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

Other? and was released on February 28, 2005. It was the first Stereophonics single to reach #1 on the UK Singles Chart or to chart on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song spent a total of 20 weeks on the UK singles chart, and it also topped the download chart, remaining on the chart for 22 weeks, half of which were spent in the top 10. The single received good reviews, James Masterton calling it the single of the year.\n\"Dakota\" was the first Stereophonics single to achieve success on alternative rock radio stations in the United States, and as such represents their American breakthrough single.[citation needed] Before \"Dakota\", no Stereophonics single had charted on any rock charts in the U.S. After its release in February, the single steadily gained ground on U.S. alternative rock radio. However, since the Stereophonics lacked a fanbase or previous popular success in America, the single was at a great disadvantage and was initially added to very few station playlists. Nevertheless, the popularity of the song and its championing by such stations as WBCN led \"Dakota\" slowly to gain airplay and playlist adds across the country over a period of many months. It became one of the 50 most-played songs in the US by mid-May 2005. However, the song lingered just within the top 50 for months and seemed destined to just miss the Modern Rock Tracks chart, a compilation of just the top 40 most-played alternative rock songs in the US.\nBut \"Dakota\" continued to gain support across the U.S. and eventually become the first Stereophonics song to chart on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. It first charted on July 9, 2005, almost half a year after its original release. The song reached #34 on the chart; it was their first and so-far only single to make the chart.\nCategory\nQuestion:\nWhat was the UK #1 single released by the band Stereophonics in 2005?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
