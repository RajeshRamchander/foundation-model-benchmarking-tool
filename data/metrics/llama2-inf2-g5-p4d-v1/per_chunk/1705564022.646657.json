The attack, in the heavily fortified Green Zone of Baghdad, occurred ten minutes after the Council of Representatives had adjourned for lunch. It was on the first floor of the Baghdad Convention Center, which houses the parliament. Two further unexploded suicide vests were found near the canteen. The building had earlier been searched by dogs \u2013 very rare considering dogs are considered ritually unclean by Iraqis \u2013 suggesting the authorities suspected an attack was imminent. Following the attack the government closed down mobile phone networks and Apache helicopters flew overhead.\n\nCasualties\nThe US military reported on 13 April that only MP Mohammed Awad had died, and that 22 others were wounded.Early reports however had said that eight people were killed, including three MPs, and at least 23 people were reported wounded. The MPs named were Mohammed Awad, a member of the Iraqi National Dialogue Front, Taha al-Liheibi, a member of the Iraqi Accordance Front and an unnamed Kurdish MP.\n\nResponsibility\nSuspicions initially centered on the bomber having been the bodyguard of an MP. A government spokesman said \"there are some groups that work in politics during the day and do things other than politics at night\". Member of Parliament Mohammed al-Dayni accused the government of lax security at the site.On 13 April, the Islamic State of Iraq posted a message on an Islamist website claiming to have sent \"A knight from the state of Islam ... [into] the heart of the Green Zone\" to carry out the attack. It is not clear whether this claim is genuine, though some who monitor such websites believe it is.In February 2009, two bodyguards of Iraqi National Dialogue Front MP Mohammed al-Dayni were arrested on suspicion of the attacks. Alaa Khairallah Hashim, al-Dayni's security chief and Ryadh Ibrahim al-Dayni, Mohammed al-Dayni's nephew, confessed on television to involvement in several attacks, including the parliament bombing. They said the MP had given authorisation for the bomber to enter the parliament area. The security forces asked the Council of Representatives of Iraq to lift al-Dayni's parliamentary immunity. Mohammed al-Dayni claimed that the accusations were lies and that his bodyguards had been tortured into making a false confession because he had been disclosing human rights abuses in Iraqi prisons. al-Dayni took a flight to Jordan, but the aeroplane was forced to turn back; parliament then agreed to lift his immunity.\n\nReactions\nWhen the bombing occurred, Saleh al-Mutlaq, the head of oppositional Iraqi National Dialogue Front, the party of the killed MP Awad, called on the United States to overthrow the government of Nouri al-Maliki: \"We need America to realize that this pro-Iranian government it has installed has allowed interference on the side of one against the other\".The Iraqi Council of Representatives held an emergency assembly the following day in response to the bombing, to \"show resilience in the face of such attacks\".US President George W. Bush condemned the attacks, saying \"there is an enemy willing to bomb innocent people and a symbol of democracy\". The Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammad Ali Hosseini described the attack as \"inhumane and satanic ... target[ting] both its Shia and Sunni officials\"Four days later three Ministers from the Sadrist Movement quit the government, citing, among other things, the growing insecurity in Baghdad.\n\nSee also\n2007 suicide bombings in Iraq\nList of attacks on legislatures\nPassage 10:\nAnant Nag filmography\nAnant Nag is an Indian actor and occasional film producer who appears as an actor in predominantly in Kannada films and a few Hindi and Telugu films.

For example, the word \"cabinet\" can mean \"storage space in your kitchen\" or \"a group of folks who advise the president.\" Beer is a word with two meanings. It can mean an alcoholic beverage made from cereal grains, or a non-alcoholic beverage flavored by root extracts. Root beer, birch beer and ginger beer are three common forms of this non-alcoholic sort of beer.\nIn the case of root beer, the flavoring comes from the root of the sassafras tree or the sarsaparilla vine. Originally, the root was brewed like a tea to make an extract, but now it is much easier to buy the extract ready-made.\nUp Next\nQuestion:\nWhat do the English know American root beer as\nAnswer:\nGinger-beer\nPassage:\nAlpine skiing at the 1980 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's downhill\nThe Men's Downhill competition of the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid was held at Whiteface Mountain on Thursday, February 14.\n\nThe defending world champion was Josef Walcher of Austria, while Switzerland's Peter M\u00fcller was the defending World Cup downhill champion and led the 1980 World Cup.\nDefending Olympic champion Franz Klammer did not compete; he was not selected to the Austrian Olympic team in 1980.\n\nGold medalist Leonhard Stock was an alternate on the Austrian downhill team, at the Olympics for the slalom. His fast training times earned him a spot on the four-man team, displacing Walcher, the reigning world champion. All four Austrians in the race finished in the top ten and M\u00fcller was fourth.\n\nResults\n\nSource:\nQuestion:\nWhat was the nationality of former Olympic downhill skier Franz Klammer?\nAnswer:\nAustrian\nPassage:\nHopman Cup\nThe Hopman Cup is an annual international eight-team indoor hardcourt tennis tournament held in Perth, Western Australia in early January (sometimes commencing in late December) each year, which plays mixed-gender teams on a country-by-country basis. \n\nThe championship is named in honour of Harry Hopman (1906\u20131985), an Australian tennis player and coach who guided the country to 15 Davis Cup titles between 1938 and 1969.  Since the Hopman Cup was founded in 1989, it has been attended each year by Harry Hopman's widow, his second wife Lucy, who travels to the tournament annually from her home in the United States. \n\nThe tournament is a sanctioned event in the calendar of the International Tennis Federation (ITF), but individual player results are not included in the calculation of the tennis world rankings. The competition receives extensive television coverage in Australia and is an important lead-up tournament to the Australian Open each January as part of the Australian Open Series. The winning team receives a silver cup perpetual trophy and up to 2014 the winning team members were presented with distinctive individual trophies in the shape of a tennis ball encrusted with diamonds from the Argyle diamond mine in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.  In 2014 and 2015, the individual trophies were created in the shape of an intricate diamond encrusted tennis racket and ball, using just under an ounce of 18-carat white, yellow and rose gold and approximately half an ounce of pink argyle diamonds. These trophies are valued at $26,000.\n\nUntil 2012, the Hopman Cup was played at the Burswood Dome. Since 2013, the Hopman Cup has been played at the Perth Arena. \n\nFormat\n\nUnlike other major international team tennis tournaments such as the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup, which are for men or women only, the Hopman Cup is a mixed competition in which male and female players are on combined teams and represent their countries. Players are invited to attend and national coaches are not involved in selecting teams.\n\nEight nations are selected annually to compete in the Hopman Cup. (The \"last\" team may be decided by play-offs between several nations before competition begins. For the 2007 Hopman Cup however, this did not occur, due to the Asian Qualifying Tournament creating the eighth team. The official tournament website also has no qualifier listed in its schedule.)\n\nEach team consists of one male player and one female player. Each match-up between two teams at the championships consists of:\n* one women's singles match\n* one men's singles match\n* one mixed doubles match\n\nThe eight competing teams are separated into two groups of four (with two teams being seeded) and face-off against each of the other three teams in their group in a round-robin format. These seedings ensure that each group has approximately similar strength. The top team in each group then meet in a final to decide the champions.\n\nIf a player is injured then a player of a lower ranking of that nation may be the substitute.\n\nManagement\n\nThe 2014 Hopman Cup Tournament Director is Paul Kilderry after the resignation of Steve Ayles.   Previously, the former Australian tennis player Paul McNamee, who played a key role in the founding of the championships, was the tournament director.\n\nHistory\n\nUp to and including 2012, the venue was the Burswood Dome at the Burswood Entertainment Complex.\n\nThe 2005/06 Hopman Cup was the first elite-level tennis tournament in which the system was introduced allowing players to challenge point-ending line calls similar to that in clay court tournaments. The challenged calls are immediately reviewed on a large monitor using Hawk-Eye technology.\n\nThe 20th Hopman Cup, in 2008, was intended to be the last held at the Burswood Dome, however this was extended until 2012 when the new Perth Arena was due for completion.\n\n2013 marks the 25th year of the running of the Hopman Cup.\n\nTelecasts\n\nThe Hopman Cup was originally broadcast by the Seven Network until 1994, then by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1995\u20132010). From 2011, a five-year deal to broadcast the Hopman Cup was signed by the commercial television station Network Ten a deal which ended abruptly in November 2013. 7mate subsequently picked up the telecasting rights. \n\nRecords and statistics\n\nPast champions\n\n  \n\nPast finalists\n\n* Consecutive titles\n** All-time: 2, United States, 2003\u20132004\n* Consecutive finals appearances\n** All-time: 4, United States, 2001\u20132004\n\nParticipation details\nQuestion:\nThe Hopman Cup is competed for in which sport?\nAnswer:\nLawn tennis\nPassage:\nGeorge Hammond (diplomat)\nGeorge Hammond (1763\u20131853) was a British diplomat and one of the first British envoys to the United States from 1791 to 1795.\n\nEarly career\n\nHammond came from East Riding of Yorkshire, enjoyed a liberal education, and was a Master of Arts and Fellow of Merton College, Oxford. During the peace talks between the 13 colonies of the United States of America and the Kingdom of Great Britain that would culminate in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, he served as a Secretary to David Hartley; while in Paris, he also learned some French. Subsequently, Hammond was appointed charg\u00e9 d'affaires at Vienna from 1788 to 1790, spent part of 1790 in Copenhagen, and in 1791 found himself Counsellor of Legation at Madrid.\n\nMinister to the United States\n\nDespite American grumbles over the lack of a British envoy since the peace treaty concluded the American revolution in 1783, the decision for the British was by no means a simple one. The Articles of Confederation lacked both a fixed seat of government and single leader to accredit an envoy, and few qualified diplomats desired the post and its yearly salary of \u00a32500. David Hartley, himself approached for the position, recommended his former secretary Hammond to Charles Jenkinson, who in turn passed on the name to newly appointed Foreign Secretary William Grenville. Hammond was soon given the job, boarded a ship for Philadelphia in September 1791 along with Edward Thornton, secretary of legation, and arrived five weeks later on 20 October.\n\nHammond initially met with then Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, but waited to formally present himself to President George Washington before an American Minister to England was chosen; his reception on 11 November 1791 formally established relations between the two countries. Although Hammond described his situation as \"new, critical and rather embarrassing\", he also stated that \"If I accepted a quarter of the invitations to dinner and tea parties which I receive I should have little time for business\", and said of the leading families that \"I have reason to think most of them are Tories at heart.\"\n\nHammond had four children, aged oldest to youngest: William Andrew, George, Margaret, Edmund. The titles (including spelling) and dates in the timeline come directly from these papers. They continue:\nIn the year 1806, when Mr. Hammond was entitled, from length of service, to a pension of 1,200 I., a pension of 600 l. was granted to him, together with pensions of 150 l. a year to each of his four children. His son, Edmund Hammond, would also join the Foreign Office.\n\nHammond left his post on 14 August 1795, leaving the consul general at Philadelphia, Phineas Bond, in charge until Robert Liston arrived in America.\n\nLater career\n\nFollowing his return from the United States, Hammond became an Undersecretary at the Foreign Office. In this position he advised and befriended Grenville and met George Canning; Canning founded the newspaper the Anti-Jacobin in 1797, and Hammond acted as joint-editor. Hammond would later be sent to one or two posts in continental Europe, and sometime in the 1810s he was appointed as a commissioner on the Arbitration of Revolutionary Indemnities, and as such spent many years living alternatively in London and Paris. Hammond died in 1853 at the age of ninety.\n\nTimeline of career\n\n*Secretary to Mr. Hartley's mission at Paris (1783 - 1784)\n*Charge d'Affairs at Vienna (21 September 1788 - 10 October 1789)\n*Secretary of legation at Copenhagen (20 February 1790 - 23 September 1790)\n*Secretary of embassy at Madrid (24 September 1790 - 5 July 1791)\n*Minister plenipotentiary to the United States (5 July 1791 - 30 October 1795)\n*Under secretary of state for foreign affairs (10 October 1795 - 20 February 1806)\n*Under secretary of state for foreign affairs (5 April 1807 - 11 November 1809)\n*Commissioner for British claims on France (September 1814 - July 1828)\nQuestion:\nIn 1791 George Hammond was appointed the first British envoy to which country?\nAnswer:\nThe United States of America\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nFeature Album - Back To Bedlam by James Blunt | Jesse ...\nFeature Album - Back To Bedlam by James Blunt | Jesse Mulligan, 1\u20134pm,  2:50 pm on 11 November 2008 | Radio New Zealand\nFeature Album - Back To Bedlam by James Blunt\nFrom Jesse Mulligan, 1\u20134pm , 2:50 pm on 11 November 2008\nShare this\nTo embed this content on your own webpage, cut and paste the following:\n<iframe src=\"http://www.radionz.co.nz/audio/remote-player?id=1780445\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"62px\"></iframe>\nQuestion:\n\u2018Back to Bedlam\u2019 was the debut album for which British singer?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",

It is awarded based on votes from international media representatives and national team coaches and captains, who select the player they deem to have performed the best in the previous calendar year. A fusion between the former Ballon d'Or and the men's FIFA World Player of the Year award, the FIFA Ballon d'Or is considered the most prestigious individual award in world football. \n\nSince its inception, the FIFA Ballon d'Or has been dominated by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of their ongoing rivalry. Barcelona's Messi won the inaugural Ballon d'Or, before reclaiming the title the following two years and again in 2015. Ronaldo, who plays for Real Madrid, won two successive awards in the intervening years.\n\nBackground\n\nPrior to 2010, the leading individual awards in association football were the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award.   The original Ballon d'Or, also known as the European Footballer of the Year award, had been awarded by the French publication France Football since 1956. European sports journalists invited by France Football selected the recipients from among European or Europe-based players. The FIFA World Player of the Year award, presented by the governing body FIFA from 1991, was international in scope. Winners were chosen by the national team coaches and captains under FIFA's jurisdiction. \n  \nFrom 2005, the winners of the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award were identical each year. Following the introduction of a global Ballon d'Or format in 2007, France Football and FIFA opted to merge the two awards. The creation of the FIFA Ballon d'Or was subsequently announced during the FIFA World Cup held in South Africa in 2010. The inaugural award was presented that same year to the Argentine Lionel Messi.  For historical purposes, both organisations regard the FIFA Ballon d'Or as a continuation of their respective former awards.   The FIFA World Player of the Year award continues as a women's-only award. \n\nThe winner of the FIFA Ballon d'Or is chosen by international media representatives and national team coaches and captains. In a voting system based on positional voting, each voter is allotted three votes, worth five points, three points and one point, and the three finalists are ordered based on total number of points. Voters are provided with a shortlist from which they can select the three players they deem to have performed the best in the previous calendar year.\n\nWinners\n\nWins by player\n\nWins by country\n\nWins by club\nQuestion:\nWho was awarded FIFA's Ballon D'Or in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012?\nAnswer:\nLeo Messy\nPassage:\nCAMELOT (The Musical): \"How to Handle a Woman\" - YouTube\nCAMELOT (The Musical): \"How to Handle a Woman\" - YouTube\nCAMELOT (The Musical): \"How to Handle a Woman\"\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

The cheese is especially known for its pungent odor caused by the bacteria Brevibacterium linens, which smells like strong body odor and particularly smelly feet. \n\nManufacture\n\nWhile today most Limburger is produced in Germany, Herve cheese is a type of Limburger which is still produced in the territory of the old Duchy of Limburg. Herve is located near Li\u00e8ge, and the borders separating Belgium from the Netherlands and Germany. The \"Pays de Herve\" is a hilly area between the Vesdre and Meuse rivers.\n\nIn the US, it was first produced in 1867 by Rudolph Benkerts in his cellar from pasteurized goat's milk.  A few years later, 25 factories produced this cheese. The Chalet Cheese Cooperative in Monroe, Wisconsin is the only American company that makes this cheese. It is also manufactured in Canada, where it is a German-Canadian cultural marker, by the Oak Grove Cheese Company in New Hamburg, Ontario.\n\nDescription\n\nIn its first month, the cheese is firmer and more crumbly, similar to the texture of feta cheese. After about six weeks, the cheese becomes softer along the edges but is still firm on the inside and can be described as salty and chalky. After two months of its life, it is mostly creamy and much smoother. Once it reaches three months, the cheese produces its notorious smell because of the bacterium used to ferment Limburger cheese and many other smear-ripened cheeses.   This is Brevibacterium linens, the same one found on human skin that is partially responsible for body odor and particularly foot odor.\n\nUses\n\nOne of the most traditional forms of eating limburger is the limburger sandwich. After three months, when the cheese has ripened, it becomes spreadable. The cheese is often spread thick (> 0.5\u00a0cm) on firm-textured 100% rye bread, with a large, thick slice of onion, and is typically served with strong black coffee or lager beer. Alternatively, for heartier eaters, chunks or slices of the cheese up to 1.5\u00a0cm thick can be cut off the block and placed in the sandwich. This sandwich still remains very popular among the descendants of German immigrants residing in the midwest part of America, such as in Cincinnati, or German Village in Columbus, Ohio. However, it is markedly less popular among the descendants born after ca. 1960, mainly because of the permeating smell, and the inconvenience of going to specialty cheese and sausage shops to obtain it. In Wisconsin, the Limburger sandwich can be found on menus at certain restaurants, accompanied by brown mustard. \n\nLimburger and its characteristic odor are a frequent butt of jokes and gags. Reactions to, and misinterpretations of, the smell of limburger cheese were gags used in numerous Little Rascals and Three Stooges comedy shorts.  Also, the arch-enemy of the Biker Mice from Mars has the name Lawrence Limburger, complete with terrible body odor.\n\nIn 2006, a study showing that the malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) is attracted equally to the smell of Limburger and to the smell of human feet earned the Ig Nobel Prize in the area of biology.   The results of the study were published in the medical journal The Lancet on 9 November 1996.\n\nNutrition facts\n\n28 grams of Limburger contains 5 grams of saturated fat and 8 grams of total fat. 67 of the 92 calories in the 28 grams are from fat.\nQuestion:\nFrom which country does 'Limburger' cheese come?\nAnswer:\nBelguim\nPassage:\nRaymond Francis\nRaymond Francis (6 October 1911 \u2013 24 October 1987) was an English actor best known for his role as Detective Chief Superintendent Tom Lockhart in the Associated-Rediffusion detective series Murder Bag, Crime Sheet and No Hiding Place. He played the role of Lockhart in these series from 1956 to 1967, and the character was one of the first recurring television detectives.\n\nBorn in London, his first listed television role was as Dr. Watson alongside Alan Wheatley's Holmes in a 1951 BBC TV series entitled Sherlock Holmes, the earliest TV adaptation of the tales. He later reprised the role in a 1984 film The Case of Marcel Duchamp.\n\nHis distinguished appearance often led to roles as senior policemen, military men and English aristocracy; he played such parts in series including Dickens of London, Edward & Mrs. Simpson, The Cedar Tree, Tales of the Unexpected, After Julius, Drummonds, the first Joan Hickson Miss Marple episode \"The Body in the Library\" as Sir Henry Clithering, and his final appearance was in a 1987 Ruth Rendell Mysteries adaptation.\n\nHe was also a noted stage actor and made several appearances in films such as Carrington V.C. and Reach for the Sky.

Following a successful launch as a Business Expansion Scheme, it became a public limited company (plc) in 1992. Paul Theakston had been managing director of Theakstons brewery, also in Masham, since 1968. He began at the age of 23, taking over from his father, Frank Theakston.\n\nTheakstons brewery was bought by Matthew Brown following disagreements between members of the family and other shareholders, and in 1987 Matthew Brown was in turn taken over by Scottish and Newcastle. Paul Theakston left in 1988, and after a hiatus of more than a year purchased the North Yorkshire Malt Roasting Company, originally part of the former Lightfoot's brewery site, from an animal feed company, in order to start a new brewery in Masham.\n\nTheakston wanted to use the Lightfoot name to bring back an old brewing tradition; however it was discovered that this name had already been trademarked by Scottish and Newcastle. The associations of Masham with sheep led Theakston to come up with the name \"Sheep Brewery\" which rapidly became \"Black Sheep\" at his wife's suggestion.The first and original Black Sheep Best Bitter was sold at the Bruce Arms by its Landlord, David Young.\n\nThe brewery produces a range of well-hopped bitters, to distinguish itself from Theakston's range of fruity and yeasty beers. The brewery quickly became successful after formation, and now produces over 75,000 barrels a year. The brewery has capitalised on its popularity by converting unused parts of the original maltings into a visitors centre to promote visits to the brewery itself.\n\nThe brewery re-launched their Emmerdale Ale as a lower-alcohol beer (formerly 5%) on 27 January 2006 at The Crown in Manfield for the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA). The launch party saw Chris Chittell (Eric Pollard from the Emmerdale TV series) pull the first pint of the new brew. Emmerdale Ale is no longer brewed. The night also marked the rebranding of Black Sheep's Special Ale (in cask form) as Black Sheep Ale, the name that it has been sold as in bottles since 1992, bringing both into line. \n\nIn 2008, the brewery launched Draught Golden Sheep, a blonde cask beer with a refreshing citrus-hop flavour. It remains a seasonal brew. This, like all Black Sheep beers and indeed the brewing plant itself was created by Paul Ambler, Head Brewer since 1992 and later Operations Director. Paul Ambler has now retired. Comments Paul Theakston, \"Over the years, Paul Ambler has been a fierce champion of the quality of our beer, which is the keystone of our success\".\n\nAll bottled beers brewed by the Black Sheep Brewery are suitable for both vegetarians and vegans. \n\nCask beers\n\n* Black Sheep Ale (formerly Special Ale), 4.4%\n* Best Bitter, 3.8%.

This dialect word comes from the old Viking words: \u2018rigg\u2019(rygg) meaning back and \u2018velte\u2019 to overturn (the words and their meaning are still largely the same in the modern North Germanic languages).
