Numerous species are distributed throughout the temperate and tropical oceans of the world, where they generally inhabit shallow water and coral reefs, and the genus is widely known for its planktonic (free-floating) species. While most species within the class Phaeophyceae are predominantly cold water organisms that benefit from nutrients upwelling, genus Sargassum appears to be an exception to this general rule.  Any number of the normally benthic species may take on a planktonic, often pelagic existence after being removed from reefs during rough weather; however, two species (S. natans and S. fluitans) have become holopelagic\u2014reproducing vegetatively and never attaching to the seafloor during their lifecycle. The Atlantic Ocean's Sargasso Sea was named after the algae, as it hosts a large amount of sargassum. \n\nHistory\n\nSargassum was named by the Portuguese sailors who found it in the Sargasso Sea after a species of rock rose (Helianthemum) that grew in their water wells at home and that was called sarga\u00e7o in Portuguese. \n\nThe Florida Keys and its smaller islands are well known for their high levels of Sargassum covering their shores. Gulfweed was observed by Columbus. Although it was formerly thought to cover the entirety of the Sargasso Sea, making navigation impossible, it has since been found to occur only in drifts. \n\nSargassum is also cultivated and cleaned for use as an herbal remedy. Many Chinese herbalists prescribe powdered Sargassum, either the species S. pallidum, or more rarely, hijiki, S. fusiforme, in doses of 0.5 gram, to be dissolved in warm water and drunk as a tea. It is called \"hai zao\" in Traditional Chinese Medicine, where it is used to resolve \"heat phlegm.\" \n\nDescription \n\nSpecies of this genus of algae may grow to a length of several metres. They are generally brown or dark green in color and consist of a holdfast, a stipe, and a frond. Oogonia and antheridia occur in conceptacles embedded in receptacles on special branches.  Some species have berrylike gas-filled bladders which help keep the fronds afloat to promote photosynthesis. Many have a rough sticky texture, which together with a robust but flexible body, helps it to withstand strong water currents.\n\nEcology \n\nThe thick masses of Sargassum provide an environment for a distinctive and specialised group of marine animals and plants, many of which are not found elsewhere.\n\nSargassum is commonly found in the beach drift near Sargassum beds where they are also known as gulfweed, a term also used to include all seaweed species washed up on shore.\n\nSargassum species are found throughout tropical areas of the world and are often the most obvious macrophyte in near-shore areas where Sargassum beds often occur near coral reefs. The plants grow subtidally and attach to coral, rocks or shells in moderately exposed or sheltered rocky or pebble areas. These tropical populations often undergo seasonal cycles of growth and decay in concert with seasonal changes in sea temperature.   In some cases (e.g., the Sargasso Sea) there are floating populations of Sargassum.\n\nIn tropical Sargassum species that are often preferentially consumed by herbivorous fishes and echinoids, there is a relatively low level of phenolics and tannins. \n\nSargassum muticum\n\nSargassum muticum is a large brown seaweed of the class Phaeophyceae.  It grows attached to rocks by a perennial holdfast up to 5\u00a0cm in diameter. From this holdfast the main axis grows to a maximum  of 5\u00a0cm high. The leaf-like laminae and primary lateral branches grow from this stipe. In warm waters it can grow to 12 m long, however in British waters it gives rise to a single main axis with secondary and tertiary branches which are shed annually. Numerous small 2\u20136\u00a0mm stalked air vesicles provide buoyancy. The reproductive receptacles are also stalked and develop in the axils of leafy laminae. It is self-fertile.\n\nDistribution\n\nSouth coast of England and several sites in the south of Ireland.\n\nSargassum adrift in Gulf Stream\n\n \n\nSargassum crisis in the Caribbean Sea\n\nIn the summer of 2015, large quantities of different species of Sargassum accumulated along the shores of many of the countries bathed by the Caribbean Sea. Some of the affected islands and regions include the Caribbean coast of Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Barbados and Tobago  The aquatic plant washes ashore, piles up on beaches, and decays, often causing a foul odor. The affected countries and territories are discussing causes of the outbreak, potential solutions, and the negative affects on tourism.  Researchers say that the Sargassum outbreak started in 2011, but it has become worse over the years. There are several factors that could explain the proliferation of Sargassum in the area in recent years. These include the rise of sea temperature and the change of sea currents due to climate change. Also, nutriments from agricultural fertilizers and wastewater from the cities, that end up in the sea, could also make the algae bloom.\nQuestion:\nSargassum is what type of plant?\nAnswer:\nMacroalgal\nPassage:\nGaribaldi (Paris M\u00e9tro)\nGaribaldi  is a station on line 13 of the Paris M\u00e9tro in the commune of Saint-Ouen.\n\nThe station opened on 30 June 1952 when the line was extended from Porte de Saint-Ouen to Carrefour Pleyel. It is named after Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882), Italian nationalist and leader of Italian unification.\n\nStation layout\nQuestion:\nA station on line 13 of the Paris Metro is named after which Italian nationalist (1807-1882)?\nAnswer:\nGaribaldi\nPassage:\nB\u00e9chamel sauce\nB\u00e9chamel sauce ( or;  ), also known as white sauce, is made from a white roux (butter and flour) and milk. Even though it first appeared in Italian cooking books (constituting one of the simplest sauces of the Italian cuisine), it is now considered one of the mother sauces of French cuisine.  It is used as the base for other sauces (such as Mornay sauce, which is B\u00e9chamel with cheese). \n\nOrigin\n\nB\u00e9chamel was a financier who held the honorary post of chief steward to King Louis XIV. The sauce first appeared in some Italian cooking books of the Rennaissance, but was introduced under its familiar name in Le Cuisinier Fran\u00e7ois, published in 1651 by  Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne (1615\u20131678), chef de cuisine to Nicolas Chalon du Bl\u00e9, marquis d'Uxelles. The foundation of French cuisine, the Cuisinier Fran\u00e7ois ran through some thirty editions in seventy-five years.\n\nThe sauce originally was a veal velout\u00e9 with a large amount of cream added. \n\nSaulnier's R\u00e9pertoire presents one recipe as: \"White roux moistened with milk, salt, onion stuck with clove, cook for 20 minutes.\" \n\nPreparation\n\nB\u00e9chamel is traditionally made by melting a quantity of butter, and adding an equal part of flour to make a roux, which is cooked under gentle heat while stirring with a whisk. As it is a white sauce, care must be taken not to brown the roux. Then heated milk is gradually whisked in, and the sauce is cooked until thickened and smooth. The proportion of roux and milk determines the thickness of the sauce, typically one to three tablespoons each of flour and butter per cup of milk. \n\nOne tablespoon each of butter and flour per cup of milk makes a thin, easily pourable sauce.  Two tablespoons of each makes a medium thick sauce. Three tablespoons of each makes an extra thick sauce, such as used to fill croquettes or as a souffl\u00e9 base. Salt and white pepper are added and it is customary in Italy to add a pinch of nutmeg.  Optionally a whole or cut onion, studded with one or more whole cloves, and a bay leaf may be simmered with the milk and then strained before adding to the roux.\n\nUses\n\nSauces\n\nB\u00e9chamel sauce is the base for a number of other classic sauces with additional ingredients added including:\n*Mornay sauce (cheese)\n*Nantua sauce (crayfish, butter and cream)\n*Cr\u00e8me sauce (heavy cream)\n*Mustard sauce (prepared mustard seed)\n*Soubise sauce (finely diced onions that have been sweated in butter)\n*Cheddar cheese sauce (Cheddar cheese, dry mustard, Worcestershire sauce)\n\nThe term \"white sauce\" or sauce blanche may also be applied to a simple sauce consisting only of milk and melted butter, without flour or spices. \n\nDishes\n\nDishes made with b\u00e9chamel sauce include:\n*Cauliflower cheese\n*Croque Monsieur (some variations)\n*Croquette\n*Fisherman's Pie\n*Lasagne\n*Parmo, a type of escalop originating in Middlesbrough, that is popular in North East England.\n*Moussaka and pastitsio, layered dishes found in Greece and throughout the Balkans and Middle East\n*Veal Orlov\nQuestion:\nWhat sort of sauce is created by combining Bechamel sauce with grated cheese?\nAnswer:\nMornaysauce\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nBargello museum Florence :: book now!\nBargello museum Florence :: book now!\nThe entrance of the Museum is on Via del Proconsolo n\u00b04 - Florence.\nMuseum\nThe Museum displays the most important collection in the world of Renaissance Tuscan sculpture, with fundamental works by Donatello, Della Robbia, Verrocchio and Michelangelo, along with a significant group of medieval French ivories, Italian majolicas and arms.\nHistory\nThe museum is housed in the medieval Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo (or Bargello Palace), built starting from 1255 and enlarged in the 14th century, ancient residence of the Captain of the People, then of the Podest\u00e0 and lastly of the Captain of Justice (called Bargello), that is the chief of the police (16th century), when the palace was transformed into a prison. The building was completely restored in order to house the Bargello National Museum, opened in 1865.\nCollections\nThe earlier museum was dedicated to Medieval applied arts: bronzes, majolicas, statues, coins, seals and medals. Donatello's year (1887-88) was the occasion to open the Hall of Renaissance Sculpture (today called \"of Donatello\") and between the late 19th century and the early 20th century, the collection was further enlarged thanks to private donations and legacies (Carrand, Ressmann, Franchetti), with new ivories, enamels, arms and armours.\nToday, on the ground floor of the museum, the Hall of the 16th century Sculpture displays important works by Michelangelo, Benvenuto Cellini, Jacopo Sansovino and Giambologna.\nOn the first floor, a balcony (\"Verone\"), adorned with bronze animals by Giambologna, leads to the vast Audience Hall, which houses many masterpieces by Donatello, his assistants and Luca Della Robbia, along with the famous bronze reliefs cast by Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi in competition for the second doors of the Florentine Baptistery. On the same floor are the Islamic Room, the Carrand Room, the Chapel of Mary Magdalene, the Room of Ivories, the Medieval Room and the Majolicas Room.\nOn the second floor are the rooms dedicated to Giovanni and Andrea della Robbia, displaying the well-known glazed terracotta works, the Room of the Arms, the Room of Small Bronzes, the Verrocchio Room (sculptures by Andrea del Verrocchio, Mino da Fiesole, Antonio Rossellino, Benedetto da Maiano) and the Room of Medals.\nMasterpieces\nBenvenuto Cellini, Mercurio, Danae with the child Perseus, Zeus, Athena, 1545-53\nBenvenuto Cellini, Bust of Cosimo I, 1545-47\nGiambologna, Flying Mercury, 1580\nDonatello, Bust of Niccol\u00f2 da Uzzano, 1425-30\nDonatello, Atys-Amor\nFilippo Brunelleschi and Lorenzo Ghiberti, Sacrifice of Isaac, 1401\nAndrea del Verrocchio , David, 1470 approx.\nAndrea del Verrocchio, Lady with posy, 1575-80\nQuestion:\nThe Uffizi and the Bargello are among the museums of art in which European city ?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
