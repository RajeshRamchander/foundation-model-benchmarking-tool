It is not unique to the modern kingdom of Cambodia: the same name (i.e. Kamboj/Kambuja) is also found in Burmese and Thai chronicles referring to regions within those kingdoms. In the Indian chronicles the Kambuja were a barbarian (in the sense of non-Indian) people in the area of modern Afghanistan. \"The application to Southeast Asia has no ethnic content and does not imply any migration of peoples from the original Kambuja; the most likely explanation is that, when Indian traders and Brahmins came into contact with local populations some two thousand years ago, they gave them the names of regions which, in their view, were similarly marginal and remote: the peoples of Southeast Asia, like the barbarian Kamboja, had no castes, did not observe proper food prohibitions and had different rules for marriage.\"  An origin-myth recorded in the Baksei Chamkrong inscription, dated AD 947, derives Kambuja from Svayambhuva Kamboj, a legendary Indian sage who reached the Indochina peninsula and married a naga princess named Mera, thus uniting the Indian and local races. In this story Kambuja derives from Kambu+ja, and means \"descendants of Kambu.\" \n\nPreah Reachanach\u00e2k Kampuchea means \"Kingdom of Cambodia\". Etymologically, its components are: Preah- (\"sacred\"); -reach- (\"king, royal, realm\", from Sanskrit); -ana- (from P\u0101li ', \"authority, command, power\"); -ch\u00e2k (from Sanskrit chakra, meaning \"wheel\", a symbol of power and rule).\n\nThe name used on formal occasions, such as political speeches and news programs, is Pr\u00e2teh Kampuchea (), literally \"the Country of Cambodia\". The colloquial name most used by Khmer people is Srok Khmae (), literally \"Khmer Land\". Srok is a Mon-Khmer word roughly equal to the Sanskritic pr\u00e2teh, but less formal.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the former name of Cambodia?\nAnswer:\nSrok khmer\nPassage:\nBorah Peak\nBorah Peak (also known as Mount Borah or Beauty Peak) is the highest mountain in the U.S. state of Idaho  and one of the most prominent peaks in the contiguous states.  It is located in the central section of the Lost River Range, within the Challis National Forest in eastern Custer County.\n\nThe mountain was nameless until it was discovered to be higher than Hyndman Peak, previously regarded as the state's highest point. In February 1934, the U.S. Geological Survey named it for William Borah, the prominent senior U.S. Senator from Idaho, who had served for nearly 27 years at the time and was dean of the Senate. An outspoken isolationist, the \"Lion of Idaho\" ran for president two years later in 1936, but did not win the Republican nomination, and died in office in 1940.\n\n1983 earthquake\n\nThe 1983 Borah Peak earthquake occurred on October 28 at 8:06:09 local time in the Lost River Range at Borah Peak in central Idaho, United States, measuring 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale.  Mount Borah rose about 1 foot (.3 m) and the Lost River Valley in that vicinity dropped about 8 feet (2.4 m.).http://www.nps.gov/crmo/learn/nature/geologicactivity.htm  The peak was scarred on the western side, and the mark is still visible.  Two children in Challis were the only fatalities of the quake, struck by falling masonry while walking to elementary school.\n\nClimbing\n\nThe normal route involves ascending 5,262 vertical feet (1604 m) from the trailhead to the summit in just over 3.5 miles (5.6\u00a0km). This route on the southwest ridge, the most popular route, is a strenuous hike for the most part until one reaches a Class 4 ar\u00eate just before the main summit crest. This point is known as Chickenout Ridge as many people will abort the attempt once they see the hazards up close. In the cooler seasons this crossing usually involves a traverse over snow, with steeply slanting slopes on either side. An ice axe, and the ability to use it, is recommended for this section when icy.\n\nBorah Peak's north face is one of Idaho's only year-round snow climbs and provides a much greater challenge than the normal route.  The face features a number of grade II class 5 routes on mixed terrain.\n\nThree climbers have died on Borah Peak.  Two climbers ascending the northwest ridge in 1977 were killed in an avalanche.  Another climber in 1987 lost his life on a glissade during descent.\n\nFile:Borah Peak ID view.webm|View from the summit\nFile:BorahPeakID.jpg|Borah Peak, looking east\nQuestion:\nBorah Peak is the highest mountain in which US state?\nAnswer:\nGovernment of Idaho\nPassage:\nEpitaph to a Dog\n\"Epitaph to a Dog\" (also sometimes referred to as \"Inscription on the Monument to a Newfoundland Dog\") is a poem by the British poet Lord Byron. It was written in 1808 in honour of his Newfoundland dog, Boatswain, who had just died of rabies.  When Boatswain contracted the disease, Byron reportedly nursed him without any fear of becoming bitten and infected.  The poem is inscribed on Boatswain's tomb, which is larger than Byron's, at Newstead Abbey,  Byron's estate. \n\nThe sections above the poem form a memorial eulogy to Boatswain, and introduce the poem. They are often assumed to form part of the poem but were written not by Byron but by his friend John Hobhouse.[https://atkinsbookshelf.wordpress.com/2012/10/17/epitaph-to-a-dog/ Atkins booskshelf: Epitaph to a Dog], 2012, accessed 11 May 2016 A letter of 1830 by Hobhouse suggests that Byron had planned to use the last two lines of his poem by way of an introductory inscription, but found he preferred Hobhouse's comparison of the attributes of dogs and people.\n\nEpitaph to a Dog  \n\nNear this Spot\nare deposited the Remains of one\nwho possessed Beauty without Vanity,\nStrength without Insolence,\nCourage without Ferocity,\nand all the virtues of Man without his Vices.\n\nThis praise, which would be unmeaning Flattery\nif inscribed over human Ashes,\nis but a just tribute to the Memory of\nBoatswain, a Dog\nwho was born in Newfoundland May 1803\nand died at Newstead Nov. 18th, 1808\n\nWhen some proud Son of Man returns to Earth,\nUnknown to Glory, but upheld by Birth,\nThe sculptor\u2019s art exhausts the pomp of woe,\nAnd storied urns record who rests below.\nWhen all is done, upon the Tomb is seen,\nNot what he was, but what he should have been.\nBut the poor Dog, in life the firmest friend,\nThe first to welcome, foremost to defend,\nWhose honest heart is still his Master\u2019s own,\nWho labours, fights, lives, breathes for him alone,\nUnhonoured falls, unnoticed all his worth,\nDenied in heaven the Soul he held on earth\u00a0\u2013\nWhile man, vain insect! hopes to be forgiven,\nAnd claims himself a sole exclusive heaven.\n\nOh man! thou feeble tenant of an hour,\nDebased by slavery, or corrupt by power\u00a0\u2013\nWho knows thee well, must quit thee with disgust,\nDegraded mass of animated dust!\nThy love is lust, thy friendship all a cheat,\nThy tongue hypocrisy, thy heart deceit!\nBy nature vile, ennobled but by name,\nEach kindred brute might bid thee blush for shame.\nYe, who behold perchance this simple urn,\nPass on\u00a0\u2013 it honours none you wish to mourn.\nTo mark a friend\u2019s remains these stones arise;\nI never knew but one -- and here he lies.\nQuestion:\nWhich poet had a dog called Boatswain?\nAnswer:\n6th Lord Byron\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nCATALONIA by All About Spain\nCATALONIA by All About Spain\nProvinces: Barcelona , Girona (Gerona), Lleida (Lerida) and Tarragona .\nBest known apart from the capital, Barcelona, is of course the Mediterranean coast, Costa Brava an Costa Dorada , with ample beaches and mild climate, doubtlessly a first rate touristical attraction.\nOne shouldn't forget anyhow that Catalonia offers as well high mountain ranges, the Pyrenees in the north,\nthe curious formations of Montserrat , the inactive volcans of Garrotxa, and a wide plain area in the region's center.\nCatalonia has a very marked culture of its own, most evidently of Mediterranean tradition, and is distinguished of most other Spanish regions in several aspects, not at least by its language, Catalonian (although everybody speaks and understands Castilian Spanish perfectly). Certainly it is one of the most cosmopolitan places in Spain, thanks to its long tradition of international commerce.\nThe coast offers ideal facilities for all sorts of water sports, but everywhere you will realize about that special talent to combine the beauty of nature or monuments with modern attractions, a main reason why Catalonia developed into one of the preferred touristical destinations.\nCatalonia's excellent gastronomy is characterized by seafood, rice dishes, wines of great international reputation and traditional desserts like the famous \"Catalonian Cream\".\nMajor attractions:\nQuestion:\nThe region of Catalonia is part of which country?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
