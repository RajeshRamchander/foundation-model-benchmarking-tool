After graduation he settled as a general practitioner in his hometown of Frankfurt. Beginning in 1845 he worked as a lecturer of pathology at the Senckenberg Institute of Anatomy. From 1851 he taught classes in anatomy and subsequently became director of the institute, a position he maintained up until his death. In 1863 he obtained the title of professor, and in 1869 began teaching anatomy classes at the St\u00e4del Art Institute.\n\nIn collaboration with sculptor Eduard Schmidt von der Launitz, he developed improved methods for drawing anatomical objects.Lucae was one of the 56 fouding members of the Freies Deutsches Hochstift (Free German Foundation).\n\nSelected writings\nSch\u00e4delzeichnungen, 1840 \u2013 \u2013 Anatomical drawings of skulls.\nZur Morphologie des S\u00e4ugethier-Sch\u00e4dels, 1872 \u2013 The morphology of mammal skulls.\nAffen- und Menschensch\u00e4del im Bau und Wachsthum verglichen, 1873 \u2013 Monkey and human skulls in construction and growth compared.\nZur Morphologie der Rassen-Sch\u00e4del, einleitende Bemerkungen und Beitr\u00e4ge; ein Sendschreiben an Carl Ernst v. Baer, 1876 \u2013 The morphology of racial skulls;  Introductory remarks and contributions; a missive to Karl Ernst von Baer.\nDie Robbe und die Otter (Phoca vitulina und Lutra vulgaris) : in ihrem Knochen-und Muskel-skelet, 1876 \u2013 The seal and the otter (Lutra vulgaris and Phoca vitulina): involving bone and musculoskeleton.\nDie statik und mechanik der quadrupeden an dem skelet und den muskeln eines lemur und eines choloepus, 1883 \u2013 The statics and mechanics of quadrupeds ... the skeleton and muscles of lemurs and Choloepus.\nPassage 8:\nJohann Christian Jacobi (oboist)\nJohann Christian Jacobi (1719 \u2013 1784) was a German oboist and composer of the Baroque period.\n\nLife\nJacobi was born in Tilsit, Prussian Lithuania (now Sovetsk, Russia). He had his first lessons on the oboe from his father, a skilled player of the violin and oboe. After the premature death of his father, he spent a period of self-tuition before moving to Berlin where he immediately sought lessons with the royal Kammermusicus and famous oboe virtuoso Peter Gl\u00f6sch. In 1746, he was accepted into the Hofkapelle of Frederick the Great and, at this time, began studying composition with his colleague, the flautist Friedrich Wilhelm Riedt.By 1754, Jacobi was employed as the principal oboist in the Hofkapelle of Frederick the Great's cousin, Charles Frederick Albert, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt in Berlin. On the recommendation of Johann Joachim Quantz, in 1768 King Frederick appointed Jacobi as the director of the Hautboistenschule in Potsdam, responsible for training the nearly 2,000 oboists in the Prussian army.Jacobi was a member of the \"Freitagsakademien\" (Friday academies), a musical society which met each Friday at the house of Johann Gottlieb Janitsch. For Jacobi, Janitsch was said to have composed all manner of trios, quartets and concertos in \"all the usual and unusual keys\". Such pieces allowed Jacobi to improve his skills as an oboist, and earned him a great reputation amongst Berlin's musical societies. Two works  by Janitsch bear a dedication to Jacobi, and several other works in extremely uncharacteristic keys for the oboe by Janitsch can be presumed to have been composed for him. They are a testament to his great skill on the instrument. Bruce Haynes lists him among the great oboists of the baroque period.Unfortunately, no compositions by Jacobi have survived.\nPassage 9:\nJohann Gottlieb Kugelann\nJohann Gottlieb Kugelann (2 January 1753 \u2013 8 September 1815) was a German entomologist.
