It covers a total surface area of 250 km2 and is a part of Africa's Great Lakes system, although not itself considered one of the Great Lakes. Like the other lakes in the region, it was named after a member of the British royal family, in this case Prince George, later to become King George V of the United Kingdom. Lake George drains to the southwest into Lake Edward through the Kazinga Channel.\n\nExplorer Henry M. Stanley was the first European to see the lake in 1875, after following the course of the Katonga river from Lake Victoria. Thinking it was part of Lake Albert, he named it Beatrice Gulf.  On his second visit in 1888 through 1889, he realized that there were two independent lakes, and gave it its current name.\nQuestion:\nIn which African country is Lake George?\nAnswer:\nUgandese\nPassage:\nRoyal Parks of London\nThe Royal Parks of London are lands originally owned by the monarchy of the United Kingdom for the recreation (mostly hunting) of the royal family. They are part of the hereditary possessions of The Crown.\n\nParks\n\nWith increasing urbanisation of London, some of these were preserved as freely accessible open space and became public parks with the introduction of the Crown Lands Act 1851. There are today eight parks formally described by this name and they cover almost  2000 ha of land in Greater London.\n\n* Bushy Park, 445 ha  \n* Green Park, 19 ha  \n* Greenwich Park, 74 ha  \n* Hyde Park, 142 ha  \n* Kensington Gardens, 111 ha  \n* Regent's Park, 166 ha  \n* Richmond Park, 955 hectares   (2360 acre)\n* St. James's Park, 23 ha  \n\nHyde Park and Kensington Gardens (which are adjacent), Green Park, Regent's Park and St James's Park are the largest green spaces in central London. Bushy Park, Greenwich Park and Richmond Park are in the suburbs. The Royal Parks agency also manages Brompton Cemetery, Grosvenor Square Gardens, Victoria Tower Gardens and the gardens of 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street. \n\nHampton Court Park is also a royal park within Greater London, but, because it contains a palace, it is administered by the Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks. \n\nLegal position\n\nThe public does not have any legal right to use the Parks, as public access depends on the grace and favour of The Crown, although there are public rights of way across the land. The Royal Parks Agency manages the Royal Parks under powers derived from section 22 of the Crown Lands Act 1851. As part of its statutory management function the Agency permits the public to use the Parks for recreational purposes, subject to regulations issued under the Parks Regulation Acts 1872\u20131926 which are considered necessary to secure proper management, preserve order and prevent abuse within the Parks. The current regulations are the Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997.\n\nManagement\n\nThey are managed by The Royal Parks (an executive agency of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport) and are policed by the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police (the English section of the previous force policing the parks, the Royal Parks Constabulary, has been abolished). The main form of funding for the Royal Parks is a central government grant. This contrasts with most of London's other parks, which are funded by local borough councils. The Royal Parks generate additional income from commercial activities such as catering and staging public events such as concerts.\n\nThe Royal Parks Foundation is a registered charity which raises funds to protect, support and create new opportunities within the Parks. They have a number of membership schemes such as adoption and champion programmes.\n\nMayoral control\n\nIn 2010, Mayor of London Boris Johnson proposed that control over the Royal Parks should be devolved to the Greater London Authority  and the government put forward proposals for that to happen later on that year.  The plan was welcomed by Royal Parks but it is yet to be implemented following the 2012 London Olympic games.\nQuestion:\nIn which of London's Royal Parks is Speakers' Corner located ?\nAnswer:\nHYDE PARK\nPassage:\nLeft-arm unorthodox spin\nLeft-arm unorthodox spin also known as slow left arm chinaman, is a type of left arm wrist off spin bowling in the sport of cricket. Left-arm unorthodox spin bowlers use wrist spin to spin the ball, and make it deviate, or \"turn\" from left to right after pitching. The direction of turn is the same as that of a traditional right-handed off spin bowler; however, the ball will usually turn more sharply due to the spin being imparted predominantly by the wrist. \n\nSome left-arm unorthodox bowlers also bowl the equivalent of a \"googly\", (or \"wrong'un\"), which turns from right to left on the pitch. The ball turns away from the right-handed batsman, as if the bowler were an orthodox left-arm spinner.\n\nOrigin of the term chinaman \n\nIn cricketing parlance, the word \"chinaman\" is used to describe the stock delivery of a left-arm \"unorthodox\" spin bowler (though some reserve it for the googly delivery [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chinaman]). The origin of the term is uncertain. One version relates to a Test match played between England and the West Indies at Old Trafford in 1933. Ellis \"Puss\" Achong, a player of Chinese origin, was a left-arm orthodox spinner, playing for the West Indies. He had Walter Robins stumped off a surprise delivery that spun into the right-hander from outside the off stump. As he walked back to the pavilion, Robins reportedly said to the umpire, \"fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman!\",  leading to the popularity of the term in England, and subsequently, in the rest of the world.\n\nAmong noted players who have bowled the chinaman is Denis Compton, who specialised in the delivery when bowling. Although better known for fast bowling and orthodox slow left arm, Garfield Sobers could also use the chinaman to good effect. In modern day, Brad Hogg is a natural spinner of the ball who popularized chinaman and has one of the most well-disguised wrong-un's. He won Australia two World Cups, picking up 13 wickets in 2003 World Cup and 21 wickets in 2007 World Cup.\nQuestion:\nIn which sport or pastime might you see six chinamen in a maiden or a nightwatchman out with a duck?\nAnswer:\nCricket games\nPassage:\nSquare foot\nThe square foot (plural square feet; abbreviated ft2 or sq ft) is an imperial unit and U.S. customary unit (non-SI, non-metric) of area, used mainly in the United States and partially in Canada, United Kingdom, Ghana, Hong Kong, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. It is defined as the area of a square with sides of 1 foot.  \n\nA symbol for square foot, square feet, and \"per square foot\" commonly used in architecture, real estate and interior space plans is a simple square with a vertical line bisecting it.  It is also occasionally written as a square with a slash through it.\n\nTo calculate the Square footing of an area, multiply the length of one side of a regular quadrilateral multiplied by the length of an adjacent side (for example, a rectangle of 0.5 foot by 2 foot would cover 1 square foot).\n\nConversions \n\n1 square foot is equivalent to:\n* 144 square inches (Sq In)\n* 1/9 square yards (Sq Yd)\n* 0.09290304 square metres (symbol: m2)\nQuestion:\nHow many square inches are there in one square foot?\nAnswer:\n144\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nLa Cage aux Folles - California Musical Theatre\nLa Cage aux Folles - California Musical Theatre\nPurchase Your Tickets Today, call (916) 557-1999\nLa Cage aux Folles\nDate(s) - Aug 19, 2014 - Aug 24, 2014\nVarious Times\nLocation - Wells Fargo Pavilion\nThis show has\u00a0closed.\nThis hilarious, bawdy musical comedy by Jerry Herman and Harvey Fierstein won six Tony Awards in 1984, and both subsequent productions won the Tony for Best Revival.\u00a0 Centered in a bustling nightclub on the French Riviera teeming with song, dance and laughter, it features \u201cThe Best of Times,\u201d \u201cI Am What I Am,\u201d \u201cSong on the Sand.\u201d\nQuestion:\nIn La Cage Aux Folles, what was La Cage Aux Folles?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
