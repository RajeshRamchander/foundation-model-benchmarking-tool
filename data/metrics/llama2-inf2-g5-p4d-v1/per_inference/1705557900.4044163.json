The family is large, with c. 4250 known species spread across 124 genera, making it the 14th most species-rich family of flowering plants. The many well known and economically important members of the Ericaceae include the cranberry, blueberry, huckleberry, rhododendron (including azaleas), and various common heaths and heathers (Erica, Cassiope, Daboecia, and Calluna for example).\n\nDescription\nThe Ericaceae contain a morphologically diverse range of taxa, including herbs, dwarf shrubs, shrubs, and trees. Their leaves are usually evergreen, alternate or whorled, simple and without stipules. Their flowers are hermaphrodite and show considerable variability. The petals are often fused (sympetalous) with shapes ranging from narrowly tubular to funnelform or widely urn-shaped. The corollas are usually radially symmetrical (actinomorphic) and urn-shaped, but many flowers of the genus Rhododendron are somewhat bilaterally symmetrical (zygomorphic). Anthers open by pores.\n\nTaxonomy\nMichel Adanson used the term Vaccinia to describe a similar family, but Antoine Laurent de Jussieu first used the term Ericaceae. The name comes from the type genus Erica, which appears to be derived from the Greek word ere\u00edk\u0113 (\u1f10\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03ba\u03b7). The exact meaning is difficult to interpret, but some sources show it as meaning 'heather'. The name may have been used informally to refer to the plants before Linnaean times, and simply been formalised when Linnaeus described Erica in 1753, and then again when Jussieu described the Ericaceae in 1789.Historically, the Ericaceae included both subfamilies and tribes. In 1971, Stevens, who outlined the history from 1876 and in some instances 1839, recognised six subfamilies (Rhododendroideae, Ericoideae, Vaccinioideae, Pyroloideae, Monotropoideae, and Wittsteinioideae), and further subdivided four of the subfamilies into tribes, the Rhododendroideae having seven tribes (Bejarieae, Rhodoreae, Cladothamneae, Epigaeae, Phyllodoceae, and Diplarcheae). Within tribe Rhodoreae, five genera were described, Rhododendron L. (including Azalea L. pro parte), Therorhodion Small, Ledum L., Tsusiophyllum Max., Menziesia J. E. Smith, that were eventually transferred into Rhododendron, along with Diplarche from the monogeneric tribe Diplarcheae.In 2002, systematic research resulted in the inclusion of the formerly recognised families Empetraceae, Epacridaceae, Monotropaceae, Prionotaceae, and Pyrolaceae into the Ericaceae based on a combination of molecular, morphological, anatomical, and embryological data, analysed within a phylogenetic framework. The move significantly increased the morphological and geographical range found within the group. One possible classification of the resulting family includes 9 subfamilies, 126 genera, and about 4000 species:\nEnkianthoideae Kron, Judd & Anderberg (one genus, 16 species)\nPyroloideae Kosteltsky (4 genera, 40 species)\nMonotropoideae Arnott (10 genera, 15 species)\nArbutoideae Niedenzu (up to six genera, about 80 species)\nCassiopoideae Kron & Judd (one genus, 12 species)\nEricoideae Link (19 genera, 1790 species)\nHarrimanelloideae Kron & Judd (one species)\nEpacridoideae Arn. (=Styphelioideae Sweet) (35 genera, 545 species)\nVaccinioideae Arnott (50 genera, 1580 species)\n\nGenera\nSee the full list at List of Ericaceae genera.\n\nDistribution and ecology\nThe Ericaceae have a nearly worldwide distribution. They are absent from continental Antarctica, parts of the high Arctic, central Greenland, northern and central Australia, and much of the lowland tropics and neotropics.The family is largely composed of plants that can tolerate acidic, infertile conditions. Like other stress-tolerant plants, many Ericaceae have mycorrhizal fungi to assist with extracting nutrients from infertile soils, as well as evergreen foliage to conserve absorbed nutrients. This trait is not found in the Clethraceae and Cyrillaceae, the two families most closely related to the Ericaceae. Most Ericaceae (excluding the Monotropoideae, and some Epacridoideae) form a distinctive accumulation of mycorrhizae, in which fungi grow in and around the roots and provide the plant with nutrients. The Pyroloideae are mixotrophic and gain sugars from the mycorrhizae, as well as nutrients.In many parts of the world, a \"heath\" or \"heathland\" is an environment characterised by an open dwarf-shrub community found on low-quality acidic soils, generally dominated by plants in the Ericaceae. A common example is Erica tetralix. This plant family is also typical of peat bogs and blanket bogs; examples include Rhododendron groenlandicum and Kalmia polifolia. In eastern North America, members of this family often grow in association with an oak canopy, in a habitat known as an oak-heath forest.In heathland, plants in the family Ericaceae serve as hostplants to the butterfly Plebejus argus.Some evidence suggests eutrophic rainwater can convert ericoid heaths with species such as Erica tetralix to grasslands. Nitrogen is particularly suspect in this regard, and may be causing measurable changes to the distribution and abundance of some ericaceous species.\nPassage 2:\nDeutzia silvestrii\nDeutzia silvestrii is a species of Safflower in the family Hydrangeaceae. It is found in central China (\u7ea2\u82b1\u6eb2\u758f; h\u00f3ng hu\u0101 s\u014du sh\u016b).\nPassage 3:\nCassiope mertensiana\nCassiope mertensiana is a species of flowering plant known by the common names western moss heather and white mountain heather.\nThis heather is native to subalpine areas of western North America, from Alaska to the mountains of California. It is a small, branching shrub which forms patches along the ground and in rocky crevices.\n\nDescription\nCassiope mertensiana has short, erect, snakelike stems that are covered in tiny leathery scalelike leaves only a few millimeters long. From between the layers of scale leaves emerge reddish  pedicels each bearing a petite, hanging, down-facing, bell-shaped flower. The bractlets are red and the contrasting flower is white.\n\nAlthough the shrub tends to grow in areas where there is a lot of accumulation of snow, adequate rain precipitation is needed for the continued growth of Cassiope Mertensiana. The shrub must be exposed to enough sunlight and warmer conditions for proper growth during the growing season.\nPassage 4:\nCassiope lycopodioides\nCassiope lycopodioides, Haida Gwaii mountain-heather or clubmoss mountain heather, is a plant species native to North America.\n\nDistribution\nIt is found in southern Alaska, British Columbia, and the US State of Washington.\nIt is found on rocky slopes in arctic and alpine tundra at elevations up to 2000 m. In Washington, it is reported only from King County. The specific epithet \"lycopodioides\" refers to the plant's superficial resemblance to some species of clubmoss (Lycopodium sensu lato).\n\nSubspecies\nCassiope lycopodioides subsp. cristapilosa, known only from the Haida Gwaii (formerly called the Queen Charlotte Islands), is recognized as a distinct taxon by some authorities but not others.\n\nDescription\nCassiope lycopodioides is a perennial herb forming mats lying close to the ground. Leaves are narrow, up to 3 mm long, closely pressed against the stem. Flowers are white, bell-shaped, up to 20 mm across.\nPassage 5:\nDeutzia\nDeutzia ( or ) is a genus of about 60 species of flowering plants in the family Hydrangeaceae, native to eastern and central Asia (from the Himalayas east to Japan and the Philippines), and Central America and also Europe. By far the highest species diversity is in China, where 50 species occur.\nThe species are shrubs ranging from 1\u20134 m (3 ft 3 in \u2013 13 ft 1 in) in height. Most are deciduous, but a few subtropical species are evergreen. The leaves are opposite, simple, with a serrated margin. The flowers are produced in panicles or corymbs; they are white in most species, sometimes pink or reddish. The fruit is a dry capsule containing numerous small seeds. Identification of the species is very difficult, requiring often microscopic detail of the leaf hairs and seed capsule structure.\nDeutzia is named after the 18th century Dutch patron of botany, Johan van der Deutz.\n\nSelected species\n\nCultivation and uses\nThe deutzias are fairly new to gardens: the exception, D. scabra, was noticed in Japanese gardens by Engelbert Kaempfer (1712) and Carl Peter Thunberg (1784) but not actually seen in Europe till the 1830s; two-thirds of the species noted in the R.H.S. Dictionary were gathered in from the wild during the 20th century.Deutzias are commonly grown as ornamental plants for their white and pink flowers. Many cultivars and hybrids have been selected for garden use, including selections with double flowers. For example, Deutzia \u00d7 lemoinei is a hybrid of D. gracilis and D. parviflora. The following cultivars and hybrids have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:-\n\nThe temperate deutzias are mostly hardy shrubs from far eastern regions where winters are dependably frozen; in milder climates, like much of England, the early-flowering species and hybrids are coaxed into premature bloom by mild spells, then spoilt by frost. Alice Coats remarks that deutzias have done better in Edinburgh, on the chilly east coast of Scotland, than in London. A solution in milder climates might be to site deutzia in the garden's most exposed, coldest microclimate, as is often done with early-flowering magnolias.\nIdentification can be difficult, and in particular, many of the plants in cultivation sold as D. scabra are actually D. crenata (Huxley 1992). The selected hybrid white double \"Pride-of-Rochester\", already in cultivation in 1881, was originated by the Rochester, New York nurserymen Ellwanger and Barry.Deutzia scabra is used by joiners in Japan to polish wood.\nPassage 6:\nCassiope\nCassiope is a genus of 9-12 small shrubby species in the family Ericaceae. It is the sole genus in the subfamily Cassiopoideae. They are native to the Arctic and north temperate montane regions. The genus is named after Cassiopeia of Greek mythology. Common names, shared with several other similar related genera, include heather and heath. They have scale-like leaves lying against the stems, and produce solitary bell-shaped flowers in late spring. Though hardy, flowers can be damaged by late frosts.\nThey are cultivated in gardens, suitable sites being rock gardens, peat banks or glades in woodland areas.,\nPassage 7:\nHarrimanella\nHarrimanella is a genus of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae, with a single species, Harrimanella hypnoides, also known as moss bell heather or moss heather.   It was originally named Cassiope hypnoides by Linnaeus (1737) in his Flora Lapponica, but Harrimanella hypnoides is now the accepted name at Integrated Taxonomic Information System. The species name hypnoides means 'like Hypnum ', which is a genus mosses.\nThe plant is a cold hardy dicot perennial found growing on rock crevices in the Canadian arctic, Quebec, the Northeastern United States, Greenland, Iceland, the mountains of Norway, Sweden and Finland, Svalbard and arctic Russia, including the Ural mountains.Harrimanella hypnoides produces moss-like cushions, about 5 cm high, often of prostrate stems with ascending shoot tips. The leaves are scale-like, looking like those of a moss. The flowers are conspicuous, white and bell shaped with five fused petals and five sepals. They are borne singly on short reddish pedicels. The fruit is an erect capsule.\nPassage 8:\nDeutzia ningpoensis\nDeutzia ningpoensis is a shrub in the family Hydrangeaceae.  The species is endemic to China. It grows to between 1 and 2.5 metres high and produces panicles of white flowers from May to July in its native range.\n```\n\nQuestion: Which as more species Cassiope or Deutzia?\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
