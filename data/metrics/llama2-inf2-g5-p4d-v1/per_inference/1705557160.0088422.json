Subsequent revisions of the book were published in 1986, 1989, 2000, and 2008.\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe first few chapters following the brief introduction about Bundy's birth and family describe Rule's friendship with Bundy, her first impressions of him, and her reluctance to consider the evidence that he might be responsible for the crimes of which he was accused.\n\nThe events of the Chi Omega murders at Florida State University in January 1978 are written in third person, but not omnisciently, as the perpetrator is not identified as being Bundy, thus keeping the documentation of these events in-sync with the knowledge available to officers at the time.\n\nIt is not until Bundy's capture and trials in Florida that Rule fully accepts that Bundy is a serial killer. She finds the idea shocking to the point that she \"[runs] to the ladies room and throws up.\"  An afterword, following Rule's lament for Bundy and his victims, describes the Kimberly Leach trial. The 1989 update outlines Bundy's execution, and the 2000 update touches on many things, including various women claiming to have encountered Bundy in the 1970s, Robert Keppel's retirement from detective work and his employment at the University of Washington, and Bundy's possible involvement in the unsolved disappearance of Ann Marie Burr, a girl who disappeared in 1961 when Bundy was 14. \n\nA 2008 update of the book includes more stories from women who have contacted Rule with stories of their \"near-miss\" contacts with a man they believe was Ted Bundy, and also a \"Ted Bundy FAQ\" section in which Rule tries to answer the questions most frequently asked by readers, including the fact that he was not responsible for the 1973 murder of Kathy Merry Devine, for which he was long suspected. DNA testing linked that killing to an ex-convict named William Cosden, who was subsequently tried and convicted of her murder.\n\nFilm adaptation\n\nIn 2003, The Stranger Beside Me was adapted into a made-for-TV film, starring Billy Campbell as Bundy and Barbara Hershey as Rule.\nQuestion:\nAnn Rules book The Stranger Beside Me, is about what serial killer, assumed to have murdered 35 people, before hitting the electric chair in Starke, Florida on January 24, 1989?\nAnswer:\nMelissa Smith (murder victim)\nPassage:\nGulf of Bothnia\nThe Gulf of Bothnia (; ) is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It is situated between Finland's west coast and Sweden's east coast. In the south of the gulf lie the \u00c5land Islands, between the Sea of \u00c5land and the Archipelago Sea.\n\nName\n\nBothnia is a latinization. The Swedish name \"Bottenviken\" was originally just \"Botn(en)\" with botn being Old Norse for \"gulf\" or \"bay\";  which is also the meaning of the second element \"vik\".\n\nThe name botn was applied to the Gulf of Bothnia as Helsingjabotn in Old Norse, after H\u00e4lsingland, which at the time referred to the coastland west of the gulf. Later, botten was applied to the regions V\u00e4sterbotten on the western side and \u00d6sterbotten the eastern side (\"East Bottom\" and \"West Bottom\"). The Finnish name of \u00d6sterbotten, Pohjanmaa, or \"Pohja\"-land, gives a hint as to the meaning in both languages: pohja means both \"bottom\" and \"north.\"\n\nBotn/botten is cognate with the English word bottom, and it might be part of a general north European distinction of lowlands, as opposed to highlands, such as the Netherlandic region, Samogitia (Lithuanian), and Sambia (Russia).\n\nA second possibility is that botten follows an alternative Scandinavian connotation of 'furthermost'. Thus, the Gulf of Bothnia would be the farthest extent of the Ocean.\n\nJulius Pokorny gives the extended Indo-European root as *bhudh-m(e)n with a *bhudh-no- variant, from which the Latin fundus, as in fundament, is derived. The original meaning of English north, from Indo-European *ner- \"under\", indicates an original sense of \"lowlands\" for \"bottomlands\". On the other hand, by \"north\" the classical authors usually meant \"outermost\", as the northern lands were outermost to them.\n\nThe origin of the word is indeed very ancient, belonging to a period before the world discoveries by the Portuguese. Until then, North was not seen as the magnetic top of the world, East being the normal orientation of a map. \n\nAlso, in Saami, the cardinal directions were named according to the different parts of the typical tent used by this nomadic people. The door of the tent was traditionally pointed South, in the most sunny direction, and the bottom of the tent would be aligned with the North. Thus the origin of the word 'Pohja' in its use as \"North\". Deriving as well from this logic is the affinity in the Finnish language of the words 'eteinen', meaning \"entrance room/hall\" and 'Etel\u00e4', \"South\".\n\nGeography\n\nExtent\n\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the southern limit of the Gulf of Bothnia as follows: \n\nFrom Simpn\u00e4sklubb (59\u00b054'N) in Sweden, to Fl\u00f6tjan, Lagsk\u00e6r [sic], F\u00e6st\u00f6rne [sic], K\u00f6kars\u00f6rn, and V\u00e6n\u00f6-Kalksk\u00e6r [sic] to the SW point of Hang\u00f6udde (Hang\u00f6 Head, 59\u00b049'N) in Finland, thus including the Aland islands and adjacent shoals and channels in the Gulf of Bothnia.\n\nGeophysical data\n\nThe gulf is 725\u00a0km (450\u00a0mi) long, 80\u2013240\u00a0km (50-150\u00a0mi) wide and has an average depth of 60 m (200\u00a0ft, 33 fathoms). The maximum depth is 295 m (965\u00a0ft, 161 fathoms). The surface area is 117,000\u00a0km\u00b2 (45,200 sq mi). The northernmost point is situated in T\u00f6re in the Bothnian Bay. its coordinates are 65\u00b0 54'07\" N 22\u00b0 39'00 E. \n\nThe depth and surface area of Gulf if Bothnia are constantly decreasing, as the land is rising after it had been pressed down by the continental ice during last ice age.  The rise is 80 cm every hundred years. \n\nInto the gulf flow a number of rivers from both sides; consequently, a salinity gradient exists from north to south.\nIn the south the water is the normal brackish water of the Baltic Sea, but in the north, in the Bothnian Bay, the salinity is so low,  from 0.4% near Kvarken to 0.2% in the northernmost part,  and many freshwater fish such as the pike, whitefish and perch thrive in it.\n\nBeing nearly fresh, the gulf is frozen over five months every year. The icing of the Baltic Sea begins and ends in the northern Gulf of Bothnia. Traffic restrictions for ice breaker assistance are typically in force for all the gulf from late January to late April and for the northernmost ports from the middle of December to the middle of May. \n\nGeological history\n\nFor the geological history of the entire region, refer to the Baltic Sea.\n\nHistory\n\nSome historians suggest that the adventurer Ottar was referring to the Gulf of Bothnia when he spoke of the Kven Sea in the 9th century. It is also possible that Claudius Clavus's usage of the term Mare Gotticus in the 15th century refers to the Gulf of Bothnia.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe land surrounding the Gulf of Bothnia is heavily forested. Trees are logged, then transported to the coast for milling. The gulf is also important for oil transport to the coastal cities and ore transport to steel mills, for instance in Raahe.\n\nIn terms of  tonnage in international traffic,  the largest ports on the Finnish side are Rauma, Kokkola and Tornio. The main ports of the Swedish side are in Lule\u00e5, Skellefte\u00e5, Ume\u00e5, Sundsvall, G\u00e4vle and Hargshamn. In Lule\u00e5, iron ore pellets are exported and coal is imported. G\u00e4vle is Sweden's third-largest container port. It also ships forest products and oil.  The Gulf of Bothnia, ice breakers assist the ports needed in average half a year, when the Gulf of Finland, the season is only three months. \n\nThere is some fishery, mainly Baltic herring, for domestic needs. A persistent problem has been pollution, because the sea is enclosed by a large drainage basin and is poorly connected to fresher waters from the Atlantic. Mercury and PCB levels have been relatively high, although the Finnish Food Safety Authority considers the herring edible. Although the levels exceed the limits, the fatty acids have health benefits that offset this risk.\n\nRivers\n\n*Kemijoki\n*Kokem\u00e4enjoki\n*Oulujoki\n*Dal\u00e4lven\n*Ljusnan\n*Ljungan\n*Indals\u00e4lven\n*\u00c5ngerman River\n*Ume River\n*Skellefte River\n*Pite River\n*Lule River\n*Kalix River\n*Torne River\n\nCities\n\n*Oulu\n*Pori\n*Rauma\n*Vaasa\n*Lule\u00e5\n*Ume\u00e5\n*H\u00e4rn\u00f6sand\n*Sundsvall\n*G\u00e4vle\n*Jakobstad\nQuestion:\nWhere is the Gulf of Bothnia?\nAnswer:\nMare Suevicum\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nDeath to Spies\nReleased in 2007, Death to Spies () is a stealth third-person shooter PC game set in World War II and produced by 1C Company and Haggard Games. The game was released on Valve's digital distribution system, Steam, on March 12, 2008.\n\nGameplay\n\nDeath to Spies takes place from a third-person perspective. The player controls Semion Strogov, a captain in a Soviet counterintelligence agency named SMERSH. Strogov is able to run, jump, crouch, crawl and climb over obstacles, and he is also able to drive vehicles. Taking place in World War II, the player is required to complete various tasks in enemy territory, such as killing targets and stealing documents. Emphasis is placed on stealth, as the player is greatly outnumbered by enemy personnel, and some missions will be failed if the alarm is raised. \n\nThe game's missions are connected by cutscenes, taking place in 1951. After the arrest of the head of SMERSH Viktor Abakumov, Semion Strogov is questioned about his involvement in a number of special operations between 1943 through 1946, as his interrogators search for any connections between him and Abakumov.\n\nThe Heads-up display shows the level of awareness and suspicion of enemies, both of which are represented with a single bar at the top of the screen and are represented separately as different icons. A vector map can be displayed on the screen, showing characters' locations and their fields of vision, in which the player will be detected either instantly or gradually, depending on the distance. The vector map also shows the radius of noises made by the player; if someone is within the radius of the noise, they may investigate the noise or become alerted, depending on the noise.\n\nDisguises can be used to avoid alerting enemies when seen. When a character is knocked unconscious or killed without damaging the uniform, Strogov can change into their clothes. Some enemies are able to see through disguises and can be alerted if the player enters their vision, and all enemies can be alerted to suspicious behaviour which includes picking the lock of a door or looking through a door's keyhole, being in certain stances or having certain weapons visible.\n\nBefore starting a mission, the player is usually able to select equipment to bring to the mission. Strogov has a carrying capacity limited to one handgun, one long gun and 18 slots for small items such as ammunition and knives; one knife can also be stored in a dedicated slot. A backpack has space for larger items such as pliers and dynamite, and space for small items, but Strogov also has a weight limit to his inventory, and small items stored in a backpack must be moved to the 18 slots before it can be used.\nA variety of firearms (along with ammunition) and explosives are available to choose from, with the choices available depending on the mission. Other weapons include chloroform, knives, a garrote and poison. German equipment can also be chosen to avoid suspicion from enemy personnel when in disguise and/or to make use of ammunition taken from enemies' bodies.\n\nSeveral missions take place in allied areas. The player is forced to begin these missions lightly armed and they cannot select their equipment. However, weapons and ammunition can be found in the level.\n\nReception\n\nDeath to Spies mostly received above average reviews. The game has an average score of 70% on Game Rankings  and 69% on Metacritic.  GameSpot gave it a 7.0, praising its detailed level design variation and challenging missions, but at the same time noting that the game can be overly difficult at times. IGN gave it an 8.0, saying it was \"horrifically difficult at times and not without its peculiarities; Death to Spies is nevertheless always interesting and wholly addictive.\" \n\nSequel\n\nOn March 23, 2009 1C Company announced a sequel, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth.  It was released on August 10, 2009.\nQuestion:\nWhich counter-intelligence agency had a name meaning \u2018death to spies\u2019 in English?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
