It was first described in 1856 as Bromelia blanda. As of November 2022, the Encyclopaedia of Bromeliads listed it under the synonym Quesnelia strobilospica, which it spelt Quesnelia strobilispica.\nPassage 2:\nHoneysuckle\nHoneysuckles are arching shrubs or twining vines in the genus Lonicera () of the family Caprifoliaceae, native to northern latitudes in North America and Eurasia. Approximately 180 species of honeysuckle have been identified in both continents. Widely known species include Lonicera periclymenum (common honeysuckle or woodbine), Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle, white honeysuckle, or Chinese honeysuckle) and Lonicera sempervirens (coral honeysuckle, trumpet honeysuckle, or woodbine honeysuckle). L. japonica is a highly invasive species considered a significant pest in parts of North America, Europe, South America, Australia, and Africa.Some species are highly fragrant and colorful, so are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. In North America, hummingbirds are attracted to the flowers, especially L. sempervirens and L. ciliosa (orange honeysuckle). Honeysuckle derives its name from the edible sweet nectar obtainable from its tubular flowers. The name Lonicera stems from Adam Lonicer, a Renaissance botanist.\n\nDescription\nMost species of Lonicera are hardy twining climbers, with a minority of shrubby habit. Some species (including Lonicera hildebrandiana from the Himalayan foothills and L. etrusca from the Mediterranean) are tender and can only be grown outside in subtropical zones. The leaves are opposite, simple oval, 1\u201310 cm (0.39\u20133.94 in) long; most are deciduous but some are evergreen.\nMany of the species have sweetly scented, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that produce a sweet, edible nectar, and most flowers are borne in clusters of two (leading to the common name of \"twinberry\" for certain North American species). Both shrubby and vining sorts have strongly fibrous stems which have been used for binding and textiles.\nThe fruit is a red, blue or black spherical or elongated berry containing several seeds; in most species the berries are mildly poisonous, but in a few (notably Lonicera caerulea) they are edible and grown for home use and commerce. Most honeysuckle berries are attractive to wildlife, which has led to species such as L. japonica and L. maackii spreading invasively outside of their home ranges. Many species of Lonicera are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species\u2014see a list of Lepidoptera that feed on honeysuckles.\n\nInvasive species\nThe spread of L. japonica in North America began in the United States in 1806, and it was widely cultivated by the 1860s. It was first discovered in Canada in Ontario forests in 1976, and became invasive by 2007. L. japonica was introduced in Australia between 1820 and 1840.Several species of honeysuckle have become invasive when introduced outside their native range, particularly in North America, Europe, South America, Australia, and Africa.  Invasive species include L. japonica, L. maackii, L. morrowii, L. tatarica, and the hybrid between the last two, L. \u00d7 bella.\n\nCultivation\nHoneysuckles are valued as garden plants, for their ability to cover unsightly walls and outbuildings, their profuse tubular flowers in early summer, and the intense fragrance of many varieties. The hardy climbing types need their roots in shade, and their flowering tops in sunlight or very light shade. Varieties need to be chosen with care, as they can become substantial. Cultivars of the dense, small-leaved L. nitida are used as low, narrow hedges.The following hybrids have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\n\nOther cultivars are dealt with under their species names.\nThe honeysuckle species L. japonica is grown as a commercial crop for traditional Chinese medicine use.\n\nPhytochemicals and sensory effects\nHoneysuckle is renowned for its colorful, fragrant flowers and variously colored fruit, indicating the presence of complex phytochemicals underlying these properties. Component analyses of berries from 27 different cultivars and 3 genotypes of edible honeysuckle (Lonicera caerulea var. kamtschatica) showed the presence of iridoids, anthocyanins, flavonols, flavanonols, flavones, flavan-3-ols, and phenolic acids. While sugars determine the level of sweetness in the berries, organic acids and polyphenols are responsible for the sour taste and tartness. Some 51 of the same compounds in berries are found in flowers, although the proportions of these compounds varied among cultivars studied.\n\nInteraction with other species\nMany insects in the order Lepidoptera visit honeysuckles as a food source. An example of this is the moth Deilephila elpenor. This nocturnal species of moth is especially attracted to honeysuckles, and they visit the flowers at night to feed on their nectar.\n\nSelected species\nSome 180 species of Lonicera are documented.\nSeveral fossil species are known from the Miocene of Asia.\nPassage 3:\nQuesnelia dubia\nQuesnelia dubia is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae, endemic to Brazil (the state of Bahia). It was first described in 2005. It is found in the Atlantic Forest ecoregion in southeastern Brazil.\n\nSee also\nFlora of the Atlantic Forest\nFlora of Bahia\nPassage 4:\nQuesnelia edmundoi\nQuesnelia edmundoi is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae, endemic to Brazil. It was first described by Lyman Bradford Smith in 1851. It is found in the Atlantic Forest ecoregion only within Rio de Janeiro state, in southeastern Brazil.\n\nSee also\nFlora of the Atlantic Forest\nFlora of Rio de Janeiro (state)\nPassage 5:\nQuesnelia marmorata\nQuesnelia marmorata is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae, endemic to the Atlantic Forest ecoregion of southeastern Brazil. It was first described by Charles Antoine Lemaire in 1855 as Billbergia marmorata.\n\nSee also\nFlora of the Atlantic Forest\nEndemic flora of Brazil\nPassage 6:\nQuesnelia\nQuesnelia is a genus of plants in the family Bromeliaceae, subfamily Bromelioideae. The genus is named after French businessman and patron of botany Edouard Prosper Quesnel, of Le Havre (1781\u20131850). Endemic to eastern Brazil, this genus contains 22 known species. This genus has two recognized subgenera: the type subgenus and Billbergiopsis Mez.\n\nSpecies\nAs of November 2022, Plants of the World Online accepted 24 species:\nPassage 7:\nQuesnelia violacea\nQuesnelia violacea is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae, endemic to Brazil (southeastern  S\u00e3o Paulo). It was first described in 2006.\nPassage 8:\nQuesnelia quesneliana\nQuesnelia quesneliana is a species of bromeliad in the genus Quesnelia.\nThis species is endemic to the Atlantic Forest ecoregion of southeastern Brazil.\nPassage 9:\nQuesnelia testudo\nQuesnelia testudo is a species of bromeliad in the genus Quesnelia.\nThis species is endemic to the Atlantic Forest ecoregion of southeastern Brazil.\n\nDescription\nIt can be found growing on trees in virgin forests near Serra do Mar.  It has a well-formed rosette of about 20 plain green leaves.  These leaves have lightly serrated edges and are tipped by a sharp spine.  The bloom reaches about a foot high. The inflorescence bears rosy red bracts and violet or white petals. It is a semi-cold hardy bromeliad that can tolerate temperatures down to 25 \u00b0F for a few hours.\n\nCultivars\nQuesnelia 'Farro'\n\u00d7 Quesmea 'Lymanii'\nPassage 10:\nLonicera caprifolium\nLonicera caprifolium, the Italian woodbine, perfoliate honeysuckle, goat-leaf honeysuckle, Italian honeysuckle, or perfoliate woodbine, is a species of perennial flowering plants in the genus Lonicera of the family Caprifoliaceae. It is native to parts of Europe, and naturalised in South East Britain and northeastern North America.  It can readily be distinguished from Europe's most common species, Lonicera periclymenum, by its topmost leaves, which are perfoliate as the Latin name suggests (that is, the stem appears to grow through the centre of the leaf). It is a vigorous, deciduous climber growing up to 8 metres.  It bears masses of very fragrant, cream-coloured flowers, tinged with pink, appearing in midsummer.\n```\n\nQuestion: Which genus has more species, Quesnelia or Honeysuckle?\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
