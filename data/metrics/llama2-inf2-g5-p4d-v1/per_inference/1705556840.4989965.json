Daniel Hine, a native Milford, settled in New Milford in 1737, and soon had a farm established here.  Abel Buckingham began farming land adjacent to Hines's in 1775.  The oldest of the three surviving houses was built about 1760 by Daniel Hines.  By the mid-19th century, both families were engaged in  dairy farming, sending their products to market via the Housatonic Railroad.  The Hines farm was sold out of the family in 1908, while that of the Buckinghams remained in that family until 1972, when it was sold to the Hendersons.

In 1791, John Smith bought 340 acres (1.4 km2) of the Jennings property. The famous brick house located there was built between 1800 and 1803. The frame tenant house was the home of various families to work on the farm. The 9.5 acres that remain of Green Hill was purchased by Stephen and Helen Matlaga in 1973. The Matlagas and their extended family painstakingly restored the main house along with two tenant houses and converted the 1867 barn into a medical office.
