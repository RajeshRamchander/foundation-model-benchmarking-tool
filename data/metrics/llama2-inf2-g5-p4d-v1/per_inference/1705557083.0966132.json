He made his professional debut in the 2005 Victorian Open, a 54-hole event played from 28 to 30 January. Draper had accepted an offer from Sam Stosur to play in the mixed doubles at the 2005 Australian Open which also finished on 30 January. Draper and Stosur reached the semi-final, which meant that Draper had to play in the first round of the golf in the morning and the semi-final of the tennis in the afternoon. Draper played his second round on the following day but missed the cut. This meant he was free to compete in the final of the mixed doubles on 30 January. On 11 February 2007, Draper won the New South Wales PGA Championship on the Von Nida Tour. He finished the four-round event with a score of 268, 20-under-par, one stroke ahead of Andrew Bonhomme and Aaron Townsend. Draper played as a professional golfer from 2005 to 2008 when a back injury ended his professional career. Although he played tennis left-handed, he played golf right-handed.\n\nProfessional wins (1)\nVon Nida Tour wins (1)\nPassage 2:\nPeter Curtis (tennis)\nPeter Curtis  (born 29 August 1945 ) is a former British professional tennis player.

Made by Hammer Films, it was adapted by Nigel Kneale from the 1960 novel The Devil's Own by Norah Lofts, published under the pseudonym Peter Curtis.\n\nPlot\nSchoolteacher Gwen Mayfield comes back to England after suffering a nervous breakdown caused by an attack by witch-doctors while working in a mission in Africa. She's hired by the wealthy Reverend Alan Bax, who runs a school in the remote village of Heddaby. Once there, Gwen finds out Alan is not actually a minister, and only wears a clerical collar out of \"a sense of security\"; the only church in the village is in ruins. Meanwhile, she befriends Alan's sister, an esteemed journalist.\nThe romance between two of Gwen's students, Ronnie Dowsett and Linda Rigg, is sternly opposed by adults in the village for reasons Gwen can't understand. Linda lives with her grandmother, who's rumoured to be a witch and Ronnie fears is abusing Linda.\nAs Ronnie is a gifted student, Alan proposes to pay for his stay at a prep school outside the village, but the boy's father is against it. Gwen volunteers to tutor the boy.\nRonnie gives Linda a male doll as a mate to her female one, to represent them as a couple. The next day, Ronnie falls into a coma, and Gwen finds the male doll with pins stuck through it and its head missing. She shows it to Stephanie, who indicates someone might be dabbling in witchcraft. Impressed by Gwen's knowledge of magical practices in Africa, Stephanie invites her to coauthor an article about witchcraft in contemporary England.\nRonnie's superstitious mother becomes upset when Gwen asks her about Ronnie's state. Later, she goes to Granny Rigg's house to work out a deal. The next day, Ronnie is out of the coma and is quickly taken by his mother to stay with her relatives in Wales. Ronnie's father confronts Granny Rigg about it and is later found drowned in a nearby pond.\nGwen starts to think people who believe themselves to be witches are behind these incidents, and realizes that if they're trying to keep Ronnie apart from Linda, it could mean they might be planning to sacrifice her as a virgin. She announces her will to testify at the inquest into Ronnie's father's death. Following an injury caused by Stephanie's dogs, Gwen is taken to the Baxes' home where she is treated by the local doctor. During the night, she gets frightened by the sudden appearance of an African totem, and suffers another nervous breakdown.\nMonths later, Gwen is recovering in a nursing home with no recollection of ever leaving Africa. After a visiting little girl's doll triggers the return of her memories, she escapes the hospital and hitchhikes back to Heddaby, where she's welcomed to stay at the Baxes' again. One of the villagers whispers to her that Linda, officially in vacation at her cousin's, has actually been taken by the witches.\nOne night, Gwen sees from the Baxes' window a group of people scurrying toward the ruined church, and goes to investigate, finding a witches' coven led by Stephanie, who reveals she had planned to initiate Gwen into their ranks. Stephanie explains that she has learned a ritual that extends life through the ritual sacrifice of a pure maiden, planned for the next night, in occasion of Lammastide. The place of sacrifice is to be kept spiritually clean or the power of the ritual will turn upon the witch. Unable to find where they are hiding Linda, Gwen waits for the ceremony. Linda is there but in a trance, unable to assist in her own rescue. As Stephanie raises the ritual knife to kill the girl, Gwen cuts herself and smears her blood on Stephanie's robe, defiling it. Seized with convulsions, Stephanie tries to remove her soiled garb, but falls dead.\nWeeks later, freed of Stephanie's influence, Heddaby has returned to normal. Gwen chooses to stay and work as a schoolteacher for Alan.\n\nCast\nProduction\nThe village of Hambleden, Buckinghamshire, was the filming location for the fictional village of Heddaby. Interiors were filmed at Hammer's usual studio at Bray in the same year that the famous horror film company vacated their home altogether for (mainly) Elstree and Pinewood. The cast featured child-actor Martin Stephens, then 17. The supporting cast also included Hammer regular Duncan Lamont, as well as John Collin, Michele Dotrice, Leonard Rossiter and Bryan Marshall. The score was by Richard Rodney Bennett.\n\nCritical reception\nVariety called the film \"routine entertainment\". The Hammer Story: The Authorised Biography of Hammer Films called the film \"unsettling, though compromised by a hysterical climax\", writing, \"when The Witches strikes the right balance it ultimately succeeds as an engrossing thriller, even if it ultimately disappoints as Hammer horror.\"On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 67% of 9 critics' reviews are positive.\nPassage 7:\n1999 Stella Artois Championships \u2013 Singles\nScott Draper was the defending champion but lost in the third round to Sargis Sargsian.\nPete Sampras won in the final 6\u20137(1\u20137), 6\u20134, 7\u20136(7\u20134) against Tim Henman.\nThis was the only year in which Roger Federer competed in this tournament.\n\nSeeds\nThe top eight seeds received a bye to the second round.\n\nDraw\nKey\nFinals\nTop half\nSection 1\nSection 2\nBottom half\nSection 3\nSection 4\nExternal links\n1999 Stella Artois Championships draw\nPassage 8:\n2005 Australian Open \u2013 Mixed Doubles\nSamantha Stosur and Scott Draper defeated Liezel Huber and Kevin Ullyett in the final 6\u20132, 2\u20136, [10\u20136] to win the mixed doubles title at the 2005 Australian Open. This was the first Grand Slam title for both Stosur and Draper, and would be Draper's only Grand Slam title.\nElena Bovina and Nenad Zimonji\u0107 were the defending champions, but Bovina did not compete due to a left foot injury. Zimonji\u0107 participated with Elena Likhovtseva, and the pair lost in the second round to Stosur and Draper.\n\nSeeds\nDraw\nKey\nFinals\nTop half\nBottom half\nExternal links\nWTA Draw Archived 2008-09-11 at the Wayback Machine\n2005 Australian Open \u2013 Doubles draws and results at the International Tennis Federation\nPassage 9:\nPeter Lamont\nPeter Curtis Lamont (12 November 1929 \u2013 18 December 2020) was a British set decorator, art director, and production designer most noted for his collaborations with filmmaker James Cameron, and for working on eighteen James Bond films, from Goldfinger (1964) to Casino Royale (2006).
