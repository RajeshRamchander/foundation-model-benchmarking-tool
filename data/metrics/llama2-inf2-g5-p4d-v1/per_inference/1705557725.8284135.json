It is a tributary of the Indus River and the Ghorband River and the Panjshir River and the Kabul River.\n\nGeography\nThe Salang River originates on the south side of the central mountains of the Hindu Kush in the north-east of Salang Pass, which links the region to Kabul with the northern part of the country.\nIts valley and the Salang Pass form an important international waterway. It is north\u2013south oriented. The Salang flows into the Ghorband River at the locality of Jabal Saraj in Parwan. In Jabal Saraj, the average annual flow module between 1961 and 1964 was about 763 millimeters per year, which is considered a high rate.\nPassage 2:\nPigna Barney River\nPigna Barney River, a partly perennial river of the Manning River catchment, is located in the Upper Hunter district of New South Wales, Australia.\n\nCourse and features\nPigna Barney River rises on the eastern slopes of Mount Royal Range, south of the locale of Glenrock, and flows generally east by south before reaching its confluence with the Manning River, south of Mount Myra. The river descends 818 metres (2,684 ft) over its 40 kilometres (25 mi) course.\n\nSee also\nRivers of New South Wales\nList of rivers of New South Wales (L\u2013Z)\nList of rivers of Australia\nPassage 3:\nTrubizh River\nThe Trubizh (Ukrainian: \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0456\u0301\u0436, Russian: \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0301\u0436) is a river entirely located in Ukraine, a left tributary of Dnieper.

The river descends 965 metres (3,166 ft) over its 26 kilometres (16 mi) course.\n\nSee also\nRivers of New South Wales\nList of rivers of New South Wales (L\u2013Z)\nList of rivers of Australia\nPassage 7:\nPeters Creek (Pennsylvania)\nPeters Creek is a 16.8-mile-long (27.0 km) tributary of the Monongahela River and part of the Ohio River and Mississippi River watersheds, flowing through southwestern Pennsylvania in the United States.\n\nVariant names\nAccording to the Geographic Names Information System, it has also been known historically as:\nPeter's Creek\n\nCourse\nPeters Creek starts in Nottingham Township in Washington County and runs generally northerly until it joins the Monongahela River at Clairton in Allegheny County.\n\nWatershed\nThe Peters Creek watershed is a diverse fifty square miles in southwestern Allegheny County and northeastern Washington County. From the heavy industry in the east where Peters Creek enters the Monongahela River, to the commercial northeast, the suburban northern communities, and the still rural and farming south, the watershed is a veritable patchwork of land use types. There is also a county park, a turnpike, a landfill, and a coal mining legacy to add to the mix. Some communities are relatively stable while others are undergoing rapid development. Peters Creek and its tributaries provide utility to them all in a myriad of ways.\n\nTributaries\nLewis Run, in Jefferson Hills\nBeam's Run, in Jefferson Hills\nLick Run, in South Park Township\nPiney Fork Run, in South Park TownshipPeters Creek also collects numerous unnamed tributaries along its course.\n\nWater quality and recreation\nBecause of past water quality issues, Peters Creek was not considered to have any recreational purpose, but since the 1990s the water quality has improved dramatically. Once plagued with garbage and acid mine drainage, the water quality is now high enough to support its own fish population, which includes trout, bass, catfish, carp, and bluegill.  It is now again possible to enjoy the stream through such activities as fishing, swimming, and during high water, kayaking. There is also a new bike trail that runs along its bank, formerly part of the Montour Railroad.\n\nSee also\nList of rivers of Pennsylvania\nPassage 8:\nCrocodile River (Limpopo)\nThe Crocodile River (Tswana: Oodi, Afrikaans: Krokodilrivier) is a river in South Africa. At its confluence with the Marico River, the Limpopo River is formed.\n\nCourse\nThe Crocodile River has its source in the Witwatersrand mountain range, originating in Constantia Kloof, Roodepoort, Gauteng province. The first dam on the river is the Lake Heritage Dam just west of Lanseria International Airport. Just north of this airport is its confluence  with the Jukskei River. Further downstream into the North West province are the Hartbeespoort Dam and the Roodekoppies Dam. Beyond the Hartbeespoort Dam, the stream passes the town of Brits. The Elands River joins downstream from the Vaalkop Dam, about 20 km further the Pienaars River joins its right bank, shortly after exiting the Klipvoor Dam.\nIn Limpopo province, about 35 km further, the river passes the town of Thabazimbi and meanders for many miles through a sparsely inhabited area before joining the Marico River just west of Rooibokkraal at the limit of North West province to form the start of the Limpopo River.\n\nTributaries\nThe tributaries of the Crocodile River include the Bloubankspruit, Hennops River, Jukskei River, Magalies River, Sterkstroom River, Rosespruit, Skeerpoort River, Kareespruit, Elands River, Bierspruit River and Sundays River.\n\nPollution\nThe Crocodile River is one of the most polluted river systems in South Africa. The effects of pollution from two of South Africa's metropolitan areas, Johannesburg and Tshwane, has been detrimental to the ecology of the system. Untreated industrial, mining, agricultural and household waste has deteriorated the water quality throughout most of its course and led to massive algal blooms in the Hartbeespoort Dam and Roodekoppies Dam. Invasive plant species have negatively affected the integrity of the system. Unsustainable farming practices have led to sediment overloads and erosion further harming the river.\n\nDams\nThe Crocodile River is part of the Crocodile (West) and Marico Water Management Area. Dams in the river basin are:\n\nHartbeespoort Dam\nRoodekoppies Dam\nRietvlei Dam, in the Rietvlei River\nBon Accord Dam and Leeukraal Dam, in the Apies River\nKlipvoor Dam and Roodeplaat Dam, in the Pienaars/Moretele River\nVaalkop Dam, in the Elands River\nBospoort Dam, in the Hex River (Matshukubjana)\n\nSee also\nDrainage basin A\nList of rivers of South Africa\nList of reservoirs and dams in South Africa\nPassage 9:\nS\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o River\nThere are two rivers named S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o River in Brazil:\n\nS\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o River (Esp\u00edrito Santo)\nS\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o River (Paran\u00e1)\n\nSee also\nS\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o (disambiguation)\nPassage 10:\nEtheostoma obama\nEtheostoma obama, the spangled darter,  is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish, a darter from the subfamily Etheostomatinae, part of the family Percidae, which also contains the perches, ruffes and pikeperches. It is endemic to the eastern United States where it is only known to occur in the Duck River and the Buffalo River, both in Tennessee.\n\nDiscovery and naming\nSteven Layman of Geosyntec Consultants and Rick Mayden of Saint Louis University studied the freshwater darters, most of which are native to Alabama and Tennessee in the United States. While they were studying color variation of Etheostoma stigmaeum, the speckled darter, Layman and Mayden discovered that there were populations with enough variation that they should be described as unique species.This species was one of five distinct species of fish that were named after former U.S. presidents and a vice-president, based on their leadership in conservation. E. obama was named after Barack Obama, for his work \"particularly in the areas of clean energy and environmental protection, and because he is one of our first leaders to approach conservation and environmental protection from a more global vision,\" according to Layman.\n\nDescription\nEtheostoma obama males have bright orange and iridescent blue speckles, stripes, and checked patterns, with a bright fan-shaped fin that has orange stripes. The males can reach up to 48 mm (1.9 in) long, while the females reach 43 mm (1.7 in) long. 29% of the studied fish had palatine teeth.\n\nSee also\nList of organisms named after famous people (born 1950\u2013present)\n```\n\nQuestion: Are Yadboro River and Pigna Barney River both located in the same country?\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
