If it is labelled \"Cr\u00e8me de Cassis de Dijon,\" one is guaranteed berries from the commune of Dijon.\n\nIn 2015, the new protected geographical indication (PGI) \u201cCr\u00e8me de Cassis de Bourgogne\u201d has been approved. Promoted by a syndicate of fruit producers and liqueurs companies from Burgundy. This \"Cr\u00e8me de Cassis de Bourgogne\" guarantees the burgundian origin and the minimum quantity of berries used in its production, essentially the variety Noir de Bourgogne.\n\nSales\n\nNearly 16\u00a0million litres of cr\u00e8me de cassis are produced annually in France.  It is consumed mostly in France but is also exported.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nIt is a favourite drink of the fictional detective Hercule Poirot.\nQuestion:\nWith which fruit is the liqueur 'Creme de Cassis' made?\nAnswer:\nGrossularia nigra\nPassage:\nJonathan, son of King Saul, friend of David, Bible bios ...\nJonathan, son of King Saul, friend of David, Bible bios, Bible Stories\nwould know that everything was okay and he could come back to  the king's house.\u00a0\n\u00a0If Jonathon told the lad that the arrows are beyond him,  then\nshould run away to preserve his own life.\nSure enough, King Saul became angry at Jonathan during dinner because\nwasn't also at the table.\u00a0 King Saul yelled to\nto go get\nso  that King Saul could kill him.\nWhen\n\u00a0tried to ask his father what wrong thing that\nhad done,  King Saul threw a javelin at his own son.\n\u00a0\nSo\n\u00a0went out to the field with his bow and arrows and a young lad.\u00a0 He shot an arrow and told the young lad that that arrow had gone beyond him.\u00a0 The young lad gathered all the arrows and then\n\u00a0\ntold the lad to go back to  the city.\nThen\ncame out of his hiding place and\n\u00a0cried together and said good-bye to each  other and promised to always be  friends.\n\u00a0\n6.\u00a0 David was the son of\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOne time            when the armies of Saul were fighting            the Philistines, King Saul made all his            soldiers take an oath not to eat until            evening.\u00a0 Jonathan was away from            King Saul and didn't hear what he said            about the oath.\u00a0\nAlthough            Jonathan and his armor bearer killed 20            Philistines by themselves, King Saul            wanted to kill Jonathan because Jonathan            ate some honey that day.\nKing            Saul's soldiers realized how wrong Saul            was and they rescued Jonathan from the            king so he wouldn't be killed.\nJonathan            fought a lot of successful battles            against the Philistines; but he was            eventually killed by a Philistine on the            same day that his father, King Saul and            two of his brothers were killed.\nQuestion:\nIn the Bible, what was the name of the son of Saul who became a great friend of David?\nAnswer:\nJonathon\nPassage:\nLeonard Bernstein, Shostakovich, Symphony no. 5, Allegro ...\nLeonard Bernstein, Shostakovich, Symphony no. 5, Allegro non troppo (1979) - YouTube\nLeonard Bernstein, Shostakovich, Symphony no. 5, Allegro non troppo (1979)\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

It consists of six equal horizontal bands of black (top), yellow, red, black, yellow, and red (bottom); a white disc is superimposed at the centre and depicts the national symbol, a grey crowned crane, facing the hoist side. \n\nDuring the colonial era the British used a British Blue ensign defaced with the colonial badge, as prescribed in 1865 regulations. Buganda, the largest of the traditional kingdoms in the colony of Uganda, had its own flag.   However, in order to avoid appearing to give preference to one region of the colony over any other, the British colonial authorities selected the crane emblem for use on the Blue ensign and other official banners.  \n\nHistory\n\nWhen the Democratic Party ruled the country, a design for flag was proposed. It had vertical stripes of green-blue-green, separated by narrower yellow stripes, and in the centre had the silhouette of a yellow crane. After the party lost the national elections on April 25, 1962 the newly elected Uganda People\u2019s Congress (UPC) rejected the former design and instead proposed the current design. It was based on the flag of UPC\u2013 a tricolor having horizontal strips of red, yellow and black. The British administration gave their approval to this design before the country's independence. The flag was designed by the Ugandan Minister of Justice, Grace Ibingira.\n\nSymbolism\n\nThe three colours are representative of African peoples (black), Africa's sunshine (yellow), and African brotherhood (red being the colour of blood, through which all Africans are connected).   The grey crowned crane is fabled for its gentle nature and was also the military badge of Ugandan soldiers during British rule. The raised leg of the crane symbolizes the forward movement of the country.  \n\nOther flags\n\nFile:Flag of the Uganda Protectorate.svg|Flag of the Uganda Protectorate (1914-March, 1962)\nFile:Standard of the Governor of the Uganda Protectorate.svg|Standard of the Governor of Uganda (1914 - March, 1962)\nFile:Flag of Uganda 1962.svg|National flag (March - October 9, 1962) \nFile:Presidential Standard of Uganda.svg|Presidential Standard of Uganda\n\nSimilar Flags\nQuestion:\nWhat kind of bird appears on the flag of Uganda?\nAnswer:\nCrowned crane (disambiguation)\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nDonald's Nephews\nDonald's Nephews (1938) is a Donald Duck animated cartoon which features Donald being visited by his three nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. This cartoon is Huey, Dewey, and Louie's very first appearance in animation.   The short, and the three nephews, was the idea of Al Taliaferro, the artist for the Silly Symphonies comic strip, which featured Donald Duck. The Walt Disney Productions Story Dept. on February 5, 1937, sent Taliaferro a memo recognizing him as the source of the idea for the planned short.  Taliaferro subsequently introduced the nephews in his comic strip, which by this time had been renamed Donald Duck, on Sunday, October 17, 1937, beating the theatrical release of Donald's Nephews by almost six months. \n\nPlot\n\nDonald receives a postcard from his sister, Dumbella, which says that her three boys, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, are coming to visit him. At first Donald is excited to see his nephews, but soon the boys start causing problems, being a constant annoyance to their uncle.\n\nDonald consults a book entitled Modern Child Training, and tries to use the suggestions to gain control over his nephews, but things only get worse. In the end, after the boys leave and with his house left almost destroyed, Donald spots a page which reads \"After all, little children are only angels without wings\". This so enrages Donald that he rips the book to pieces and explodes.\n\nNephews Antics\n\nThroughout the cartoon, Huey, Dewey, and Louie play tricks on their Uncle Donald in order to annoy him. They cause extensive damage throughout his house, and have fun at Donald's expense. Some of their activities include:\n* Playing croquet on tricycles in Donald's living room, breaking vases, lamps, and windows\n* As Donald plays the piano to try to calm his nephews, the boys pick up instruments to play along with him, however Dewey uses his trombone to launch an apple at Donald, and Huey uses his cello to project his bow at Donald\n* While Donald plays the piano, Huey fills a bag with water, and Louie bursts it with his slingshot\n* Giving Donald a pie full of scorching hot mustard, then, to cool him down, they throw water on him and spray him in the face with a fire extinguisher, then throw his book at him and ride away on their tricycles\n\nAvailability\n\n* Walt Disney's Funny Factory With Huey Dewey & Louie Vol. 4\nQuestion:\nWhat are the names of Donald Duck's three nephews?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
