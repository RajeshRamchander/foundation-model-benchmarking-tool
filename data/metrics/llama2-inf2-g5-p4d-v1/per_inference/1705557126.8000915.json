It is similar to Blue Stilton cheese, except that it does not use pasteurised milk or factory-produced rennet.  The name comes from a form of the name of Stilton village in the 1086 Domesday Book (Stichiltone/Sticiltone), as the name Stilton cannot legally be used for the cheese. \n\nRandolph Hodgson of Neal's Yard Dairy and American Joe Schneider produce Stichelton in small batches in a dairy at Cuckney on the northern edge of Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire. They use raw milk, rennet from calves' stomachs and hand-ladling and smoothing.\n\nHistory \n\nAlthough most Stilton cheeses have been made with pasteurised milk for many years, until 1989 the Colston Bassett dairy did make one Stilton with unpasteurised milk. However, following an outbreak of food poisoning incorrectly linked to the dairy  and subsequently revealed to be unfounded,http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2007/dec/18/rhapsodyinblue The Guardian Unlimited, 18 December 2007 they decided to end production of the unpasteurised cheese. In 1996, this decision was permanently enshrined when Stilton was awarded Protected Designation of Origin status by the EU, with one of the criteria being the use of pasteurised cows milk. \n\nStichelton is produced by a partnership including Randolph Hodgson who owns the specialist cheese retailer Neal's Yard Dairy, and Joe Schneider who is an American who had been a cheesemaker in the Netherlands and the UK. In late 2004 Schneider and Hodgson discussed the possibility of recreating an unpasteurised Stilton-style cheese. They eventually found premises in which to start their dairy, on the Welbeck Abbey Estate near Worksop in Nottinghamshire.\n\nUnable to be described as a Stilton, the new cheese was named Stichelton, which its makers say was based on the original name of the village of Stilton (the spelling Stichelton appears in the 13th century Lincoln Rolls). The first Stichelton cheese was produced in October 2006,  reportedly from a starter culture obtained from the original producer by Hodgson's colleague, and subsequently kept alive for fifteen years.http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/the-cheesemonger/the-cheesemonger-stichelton-046208 The Cheesemonger Website\n\nManufacture \n\nStichelton is made in a dairy, from the unpasteurised milk of Friesian-Holstein cows at Collinthwaite Farm, on the Welbeck Estate in Nottinghamshire. ForbesLife magazine described it as a \"sumptuous cheese that sets a full-flavored, succulent, complex chain of sensations going in your mouth: fruity and salty, buttery, and earthy, sharp and creamy. Robin Hood never had it so good.\" The starter culture for the cheese is known as MT36, the original culture used in the pre-1989 unpasteurised Stiltons, and is different from the culture that is used in modern pasteurised ones.  MT36 was nearly lost, but a vial of it was sent to Ray Osborne, a starter producer, who kept it alive for 18 years.\nQuestion:\nSaga and Stichelton are types of which foodstuff?\nAnswer:\nCheeses\nPassage:\nRealgar\nRealgar, \u03b1-As4S4, is an arsenic sulfide mineral, also known as \"ruby sulphur\" or \"ruby of arsenic\". It is a soft, sectile mineral occurring in monoclinic crystals, or in granular, compact, or powdery form, often in association with the related mineral, orpiment (As2S3). It is orange-red in color, melts at 320\u00a0\u00b0C, and burns with a bluish flame releasing fumes of arsenic and sulfur. Realgar is soft with a Mohs hardness of 1.5 to 2 and has a specific gravity of 3.5. Its streak is orange colored. It is trimorphous with alacranite and pararealgar.\nIts name comes from the Arabic rahj al-\u0121\u0101r (,  \"powder of the mine\"), via Catalan and Medieval Latin, and its earliest record in English is in the 1390s. \n\nOccurrence \n\nRealgar most commonly occurs as a low-temperature hydrothermal vein mineral associated with other arsenic and antimony minerals. It also occurs as volcanic sublimations and in hot spring deposits. It occurs in association with orpiment, arsenolite, calcite and barite.\n\nIt is found with lead, silver and gold ores in Hungary, Bohemia and Saxony. In the US it occurs notably in Mercur, Utah; Manhattan, Nevada and in the geyser deposits of Yellowstone National Park.\n\nIt is commonly held that after a long period of exposure to light realgar changes form to a yellow powder known as pararealgar (\u03b2-As4S4). It was once thought that this powder was the yellow sulfide orpiment, but has been recently shown to be a distinct chemical compound.\n\nUses\n\nRealgar, orpiment, and arsenopyrite provide nearly all the world's supply of arsenic as a byproduct of smelting concentrates derived from these ores.\n\nRealgar was used by firework manufacturers to create the color white in fireworks prior to the availability of powdered metals such as aluminium, magnesium and titanium. It is still used in combination with potassium chlorate to make a contact explosive known as \"red explosive\" for some types of torpedoes and other novelty exploding fireworks branded as 'cracker balls', as well in the cores of some types of crackling stars.\n\nRealgar is toxic. The ancient Greeks, who called it \"sandaracha\", understood it is poisonous. It was used to poison rats in medieval Spain and in 16th century England.  It is still sometimes used to kill weeds, insects, and rodents,  even though more effective arsenic-based agents are available.\n\nThe Chinese name for realgar is xionghuang \u96c4\u9ec3, literally 'masculine yellow', as opposed to orpiment which was 'feminine yellow'. Its toxicity was also well known to them, and it was frequently sprinkled around houses to repel snakes and insects, as well as being used in Chinese medicine.  Realgar is mixed with rice liquor to make realgar wine, which is consumed during the Dragon Boat Festival in order to ward off evil, alluding to its repellent properties. (This practice has become rarer in modern times, with the awareness that realgar is a toxic arsenic compound.)\n\nRealgar was commonly applied in leather manufacturing to remove the hair from animal pelts. Because realgar is a known carcinogen, and an arsenic poison, and because competitive substitutes are available, it is rarely used today for this purpose.\n\nRealgar was, along with orpiment, a significant item of trade in the ancient Roman Empire and was used as a red paint pigment. Early occurrences of realgar as a red painting pigment are known for works of art from China, India, Central Asia, and Egypt. It was used in European fine-art painting during the Renaissance era, a use which died out by the 18th century.   It was also used as medicine.\n\nOther traditional uses include manufacturing lead shot, printing and dyeing calico cloth.\n\nRealgar gallery \n\nFile:Realgar-151586.jpg|Realgar, gemmy crystals on calcite, 8.9 x 6.9 x 3.6 cm.

His progress was helped when the favourite, Must, and a previous winner, Early Mist, fell early on. \n\nHe went to the front of the race with three jumps remaining, cleared the last half a length ahead of E.S.B., and took a commanding lead on the final stretch. Then, in front of the royal box just 40 yards from the winning post and five lengths ahead, he suddenly inexplicably jumped into the air and landed on his stomach, allowing E.S.B. to overtake and win. Although jockey Dick Francis tried to cajole the horse, it was unable to continue. Afterwards, the Queen Mother said: \"Oh, that's racing.\"  \n\nIt is still uncertain and debated to this day as to why Devon Loch jumped; some reports claimed he suffered a cramp in his hindquarters causing the collapse. Another report asserted that a shadow thrown by the adjacent water-jump fence (which horses only traverse on the first circuit of the Aintree course) may have baffled Devon Loch into thinking a jump was required and\u00a0\u2013 confused as to whether he should jump or not\u00a0\u2013 he half-jumped and collapsed.  Jockey Dick Francis later stated that a loud cheer from the crowd, for an expected royal winner, distracting the horse is a more likely explanation.\n\nReports that the horse had suffered a heart attack were dismissed, as Devon Loch recovered far too quickly for this to have been the case. He lived another six years, being put down during or shortly after the cold winter of 1962\u20133.\n\nModern use\n\n\"To do a Devon Loch\" is a modern metaphor now sometimes used in sports and otherwise to explain a sudden, last-minute failure of teams or a sportsperson to complete an expected victory, for example: \"Manchester United won't do a Devon Loch and lose the title after beating Chelsea\"  or \"Lewis Hamilton surrendering the championship having led Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by 17 points with just two races remaining was a Devon Loch calamity\".  Another example occurred ahead of the 2011 Irish presidential election when Se\u00e1n Gallagher's campaign came undone in the final television debate, his fall from grace was compared to Devon Loch's fall just before the winning post in the 1956 Grand National. \n\nIn an article in The Times on 4 August 2012, Rick Broadbent wrote about the final day of the 2012 Olympics heptathlon competition: \"Jessica Ennis is almost there. It would take a Devon Loch-style collapse to deny her the gold medal now.\"  Referencing Leicester City F.C.'s position atop the Premier League table into the second half of the season, on January 23, 2016 Stuart James for The Guardian wrote, \"Without wishing to put any extra pressure on Ranieri and his players, it is starting to look as though it would take a Devon Loch-style collapse for Leicester to miss out on a place in the top four.\"\nQuestion:\nWhich jockey rode 'Devon Loch' in the 1956 Grand National?\nAnswer:\nShattered (Dick Francis novel)\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nThe Red Brigade terrorizes Italy - Apr 18, 1974 - HISTORY.com\nThe Red Brigade terrorizes Italy - Apr 18, 1974 - HISTORY.com\nThe Red Brigade terrorizes Italy\nShare this:\nThe Red Brigade terrorizes Italy\nAuthor\nThe Red Brigade terrorizes Italy\nURL\nPublisher\nA+E Networks\nOn this day in 1974, Italian prosecutor Mario Sossi is kidnapped by the Red Brigades. It was the first time that the left-wing terrorist group had directly struck the Italian government, marking the beginning of tensions that lasted for 10 years.\nThe Red Brigades were founded by college student Renato Curcio in 1969 to battle \u201cagainst the imperialist state of the multinationals.\u201d At first, the fledgling organization restricted its activities to small acts of vandalism and arson. However, in 1972, they abducted business executive Idalgo Macchiarini, releasing him a short time later with a sign that said, \u201cHit one to educate 100. Power to the armed populace.\u201d The Red Brigades kidnapped several other executives in the years following.\nThe kidnapping of Mario Sossi marked the first time that the Red Brigades demanded a ransom: They insisted on the release of eight imprisoned members. After fellow prosecutor Francesco Coco agreed to the demand, Sossi was released. However, Coco reneged on the deal and infuriated the Red Brigades.\nOver the next several years, the terrorist group kidnapped 26 wealthy men and women to fund their criminal enterprises, extorting as much as $2 million for one abduction. They also got revenge on Coco, killing him in 1976. That same year, 49 members were prosecuted in Turin, prompting several retaliatory shootings against government officials.\nIn 1978, the ante was upped even further after some of the Red Brigades\u2019 leaders were arrested. Aldo Moro, a former Italian prime minister, was kidnapped on March 16, 1978, and five bodyguards were killed in the attack. For 55 days, the terrorists made various demands while taunting Moro\u2019s family with fake death announcements. On May 9, after their demands were refused, Moro\u2019s body was found in the trunk of a red car in the middle of Rome. He had been shot 11 times in the chest. The Red Brigades killed seven more politicians in the next week, terrorizing the whole country of Italy.\nSixty-three persons ended up being charged with involvement in Moro\u2019s murder. Prospero Gallinari, the actual shooter, and 22 others were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. The Red Brigades were finally crushed in the early 1980s when over 400 members were jailed.\nRelated Videos\nQuestion:\nWhich former Italian Prime Minister was kidnapped by The Red Brigade in 1978, and killed after 55 days in captivity?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
