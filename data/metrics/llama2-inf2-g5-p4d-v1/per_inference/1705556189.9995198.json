The word \"coven\" remained largely unused in English until 1921 when Margaret Murray promoted the idea, now much disputed, that all witches across Europe met in groups of thirteen which they called \"covens.\"  \n\nNeopaganism\n\nIn Wicca and other similar forms of modern neopagan witchcraft, such as Stregheria and Feri, a coven is a gathering or community of witches, much like a congregation in Christian parlance. It is composed of a group of believers who gather together for ceremonies of worship such as Drawing Down the Moon, or celebrating the Sabbats.\nThe number of persons involved may vary. Although thirteen is considered ideal (probably in deference to Murray's theories), any group of at least three can be a coven. A group of two is usually called a \"working couple\" (regardless of their sexes). Within the community, many believe that a coven larger than thirteen is unwieldy, citing unwieldy group dynamics and an unfair burden on the leadership.  When a coven has grown too large to be manageable, it may split, or \"hive\". In Wicca this may also occur when a newly made High Priest or High Priestess, also called 3rd Degree ordination, leaves to start their own coven.\nWiccan covens are usually jointly led by a High Priestess and a High Priest, though some are led by only one or the other. In more recent forms of neopagan witchcraft, covens are sometimes run as democracies with a rotating leadership.\n\nOnline covens\n\nWith the rise of the internet as a platform for collaborative discussion and media dissemination, it became popular for adherents and practitioners of Wicca to establish (often paid subscription-based) \"online covens\" which remotely teach tradition-specific crafts to students in a similar method of education as non-religious virtual online schools.\n\nOne of the first online covens to take this route is the Coven of the Far Flung Net, which was established in 1998 as the online arm of the Church of Universal Eclectic Wicca.\n\nHowever, because of potentially-unwieldy membership sizes, many online covens limit their memberships to anywhere between 10 and 100 students. The CFFN, in particular, tried to devolve its structure into a system of sub-coven clans (which governed their own application processes), a system which ended in 2003 due to fears by the CFFN leadership that the clans were becoming communities in their own right.\n\nUsage in literature and popular culture \n\nIn fantasy stories and popular culture, a coven is a gathering of witches to work spells in tandem.  Such imagery can be traced back to Renaissance prints depicting witches and to the three \"weird sisters\" in Shakespeare's Macbeth. Orgiastic meetings of witches are also depicted in the Robert Burns poem \"Tam o' Shanter\" and in the Goethe play Faust. Movies featuring covens include Suspiria, Rosemary's Baby, Four Rooms, The Covenant, Underworld, Underworld: Evolution, The Craft, Coven, Paranormal Activity 3 and  The Witch.\n\nIn television, covens have been portrayed in U.S. supernatural dramas Charmed, Witches of East End, The Originals, The Secret Circle and True Blood. In the 1967 Star Trek original series episode \"Catspaw\", three witches appeared as illusions and acted in unison to voice a warning to Kirk and the landing party to leave the planet. The third season of American Horror Story is titled Coven and focuses on witches.\n\nIn novels such as The Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice and the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer, covens are families or unrelated groups of vampires who live together.\nQuestion:\nWhat is a group of witches called?\nAnswer:\nCoven\nPassage:\nJohanna Spyri\nJohanna Louise Spyri (n\u00e9e Heusser) (; 12 June 1827 \u2013 7 July 1901) was a Swiss-born author of novels, notably children's stories, and is best known for her book Heidi. Born  in the rural area of Hirzel, Switzerland, as a child she spent several summers in the area around Chur in Graub\u00fcnden, the setting she later would use in her novels.\n\nBiography\n\nIn 1852, Johanna Heusser married Bernhard Spyri. Bernhard was a lawyer. While living in the city of Z\u00fcrich she began to write about life in the country. Her first story, A Note on Vrony's Grave, which deals with a woman's life of domestic violence, was published in 1880; the following year further stories for both adults and children appeared, among them the novel Heidi, which she wrote in four weeks. Heidi is the story of an orphan girl who lives with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps, and is famous for its vivid portrayal of that landscape.\n\nHer husband and her only child, named Bernard, both died in 1884. Alone, she devoted herself to charitable causes and wrote over fifty more stories before her death in 1901. She was interred in the family plot at the Sihlfeld-A Cemetery in Z\u00fcrich. An icon in Switzerland, Spyri's portrait was placed on a postage stamp in 1951 and on a 20 CHF commemorative coin in 2009.\n\nIn April 2010 a professor searching for children's illustrations found a book written in 1830 by a German history teacher, Hermann Adam von Kamp, that Johanna may have used as a basis for Heidi. The 1830 story is titled Adelheide - das M\u00e4dchen vom Alpengebirge\u2014translated, \"Adelaide, the girl from the Alps\". The two stories share many similarities in plot line and imagery. Spyri biographer Regine Schindler said it was entirely possible that Johanna may have been familiar with the story as she grew up in a literate household with many books.[http://www.3sat.de/dynamic/sitegen/bin/sitegen.php?tab\n2&source=/kulturzeit/themen/143450/index.html Ur-Heidi aus dem Ruhrpott.

The translations into English at the end of the 19th century, or the early 1900s, mention H. A. Melcon (1839-1910), Marie Louise Kirk (1860-1936), Emma Stelter Hopkins, Louise Brooks, Helen B. Dole and the couple Charles Wharton Stork and Elisabeth P. Stork.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name of the little girl in the popular children's novel by Johanna Spyri?\nAnswer:\nHeidi.\nPassage:\nGarigliano\nThe Garigliano is a river in central Italy.\n\nIt forms at the confluence of the rivers Gari (also known as the Rapido) and Liri. Garigliano is actually a deformation of \"Gari-Lirano\" (which in Italian means something like \"Gari from the Liri\"). In ancient times the whole course of the Liri and Gagliano was known as the Liris.\n\nFor the most part of its 40 km length, the Garigliano River marks the border between the Italian regions of Lazio and Campania. In medieval times, the river (then known as the Verde) marked the southern border of the Papal States.\n\nHistorical significance\n\nIn the 9th and early 10th centuries a band of Arabs established themselves on the banks of the Garigliano, from where they launched frequent raids on Campania and central Italy. In 915 a coalition of the pope, the Byzantines, Franks, Lombards, and Naples defeated the Garigliano Arabs in the Battle of Garigliano.\n\nIn 1503 Spanish and French forces fought another battle of Garigliano, in which Piero II de' Medici was drowned, thus control of the Medici family passed to Giovanni de' Medici, later Pope Leo X. The bigger French Army was practically destroyed at little cost to the Spanish, with the remnants later surrendering at Gaeta.\n\nDuring the Italian Campaign of World War II, the Liri-Gari-Garigliano rivers stood at the centre of a system of German defensive lines (the most famous of which is the Gustav Line) around which the battle of Monte Cassino took place in 1943-1944. Rumours tell that the waters of the river ran red in the Cassino area during the famous battle, because of the blood of the many corpses of soldiers.\n\nNuclear power plant \n\nFrom 1959 until 1982 there has been a BWR nuclear power plant named Garigliano near the town Sessa Aurunca.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name of the line of fortification that ran across Italy during World War II from just north of where the Garigliano River flows into the Tyrrhenian Sea in the west, through the Apennine Mountains to the mouth of the Sangro River on the Adriatic coast in the east via Monte Cassino and Monte Cairo?\nAnswer:\nWinter Line\nPassage:\nNational Rail Enquiries - Station facilities for ...\nNational Rail Enquiries - Station facilities for Warrington Bank Quay\nYes\nPlusBike (cycle hire)\nBrompton Bike Hire is available at the station. \u00a0They have two tariffs to chose from; frequent and leisure. \u00a0Each has an annual membership fee and a daily hire charge. \u00a0Please\u00a0 click here \u00a0for more information.\nCar Park\nWarrington Bank Quay Car Park 1 - Parker Street\nOperator\nQuestion:\nWBQ is the National Rail code for which station in the North West?\nAnswer:\nWarrington Bank Quay railway station\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nHoy (boat)\nA hoy was a  small sloop-rigged coasting ship or  a heavy barge used for freight, usually with a burthen of about 60 tons (bm).  The word derives from the  Middle Dutch hoey. In 1495, one of the Paston Letters included the phrase, An hoye of Dorderycht (a hoy of Dordrecht), in such a way as to indicate that such contact was then no more than mildly unusual. The English term was first used on the Dutch Heude-ships that entered service with the British Royal Navy.\n\nEvolution and use\n\nOver time the hoy evolved in terms of its design and use. In the fifteenth century a hoy might be a small spritsail-rigged warship like a cromster. Like the earlier forms of the French chaloupe, it could be a heavy and unseaworthy harbour boat or a small coastal sailing vessel (latterly, the chaloupe was a pulling cutter \u2013 nowadays motorized). By the 18th and 19th Century hoys were sloop-rigged and the mainsail could be fitted with or without a boom. English hoys tended to be single-masted, whereas Dutch hoys had two masts.\nPrincipally, and more so latterly, the hoy was a passenger or cargo boat. For the English, a hoy was a ship working in the Thames Estuary and southern North Sea in the manner of the Thames sailing barge of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In the Netherlands a slightly different vessel did the same sort of work in similar waters. Before the development of steam engines, the passage of boats in places like the Thames estuary and the estuaries of the Netherlands, required the skillful use of tides as much as of the wind.\n\nHoys also would carry cargo or passengers to the larger ships anchored in the Thames. The British East India Company used hoys as lighters for larger ships that could not travel up the Thames to London. These were commonly referred to as East India hoys.\n\nIn the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, English hoys plied a trade between London and the north Kent coast that enabled middle class Londoners to escape the city for the more rural air of Margate, for example. Others sailed between London and Southampton. These were known as Margate or Southampton hoys and one could hail them from the shore to pick up goods and passengers.\n\nThe introduction of the early steamers greatly expanded this sort of trade. At the same time, barges were taking over the cargo coasting trade on the short routes. Together, these developments meant that hoys fell out of use.\n\nRoyal Navy\n\n \nThe British Royal Navy used hoys that were specially built to carry fresh water, gunpowder or ballast. Some were employed in such tasks as laying buoys or survey work, while others served to escort coastal convoys. Still others were in the Revenue service.\n\nIn 1793\u201394 the Royal Navy purchased 19 Dutch hoys as coastal gun-vessels, particularly for service under Admiral Sir Sidney Smith. In naval service these had 30-man crews and each carried one 24-pounder gun and three 32-pounder carronades. Examples include  and  (Sharks crew mutinied in 1795 and handed her over to the French). Around the end of the French Revolutionary Wars, the Navy sold its remaining armed hoys.\n\nConcern about a possible French invasion led the Royal Navy on 28 September 1804 to arm 16 hoys at Margate for the defense of the coast. One of these bore the name King George. The Navy manned each hoy with a captain and nine men from the Sea Fencibles.  The same concern also led the British to build over a hundred Martello towers along the British and Irish coasts.\n\nBecause most hoys were merchantmen, they were also frequently taken as prizes during time of war. Many of the hoys in British naval service had been captured from enemies. One of the earliest on record was the , captured in 1522 and listed until 1525.\nQuestion:\nA traditional hoy boat is powered by?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
