Cream is sometimes used as well. It is a basic preparation used in stuffings and sauces (notably, beef Wellington) or as a garnish. Duxelles can also be filled into a pocket of raw pastry and baked as a savory tart. \n\nDuxelles is made with any cultivated or wild mushroom, depending on the recipe. Duxelles made with wild porcini mushrooms will be much stronger flavored than that made with white or brown mushrooms.\n\nDuxelles is said to have been created by the 17th-century French chef Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne (1615\u20131678) and to have been named after his employer, Nicolas Chalon du Bl\u00e9, marquis d'Uxelles, mar\u00e9chal de France.\n\nMany classical cookbooks define duxelles as dehydrated fungi, used as stuffings and pastry fillings. According to Auguste Escoffier (1847\u20131935), a world-renowned French chef regarded as the father of classical cuisine, the mushrooms were dehydrated in order to enhance flavor and minimize water content.  When fresh mushrooms are cooked, they let off enormous amounts of vapor in relation to their size.  Fresh mushrooms used as stuffings or pastry fillings could therefore build up pressure inside the dish or pastry, causing it to crack or even explode.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the main ingredient of Duxelles sauce or Duxelles stuffing?\nAnswer:\nPsychoactive mushroom\nPassage:\nRear of the Year\nRear of the Year is a light-hearted British award for celebrities who are considered to have a notable posterior. It was created by publicity consultant Anthony Edwards  and is organised by Rear of the Year Limited. It was for several years awarded to women only; now it is usually awarded to one woman and one man. Bookmakers are never supplied with a list of contenders, so their suppositions about the outcome are pure conjecture.\n\nHistory\n\nBarbara Windsor won the first award in 1976, presented as a one-off accolade. Five years later it became an annual event with Felicity Kendal taking away the honours. In 1986 the award was presented to a man for the first time (Michael Barrymore) and 1991 saw Marina Ogilvy, the daughter of Princess Alexandra, became the first royal recipient. From 1997 the awards have been presented annually to both sexes.\n\nThe event, staged for the past few years at London's Dorchester Hotel in Park Lane, attracts major national and international press publicity valued at circa \u00a34.5 million. In 2012, Organiser Tony Edwards declared that female rears were starting to slim down as more women took to the gym, jogging, and keeping in trim in this Olympic year.\n\nIn 2014, Carol Vorderman became the first person to receive the award for a second time.\n\nWinners\n\n*1976 \u2014 Barbara Windsor\n*1981 \u2014 Felicity Kendal\n*1982 \u2014 Suzi Quatro\n*1983 \u2014 Lulu\n*1984 \u2014 Elaine Paige\n*1985 \u2014 Lynsey De Paul\n*1986 \u2014 Anneka Rice and Michael Barrymore\n*1987 \u2014 Anita Dobson\n*1988 \u2014 Su Pollard\n*1989 \u2014 No competition\n*1990 \u2014 No competition\n*1991 \u2014 Marina Ogilvy\n*1992 \u2014 Ulrika Jonsson\n*1993 \u2014 Sarah Lancashire\n*1994 \u2014 Mandy Smith and Richard Fairbrass\n*1995 \u2014 No competition\n*1996 \u2014 Tracy Shaw\n*1997 \u2014 Melinda Messenger and Gary Barlow\n*1998 \u2014 Carol Smillie and Frank Skinner\n*1999 \u2014 Denise van Outen and Robbie Williams\n*2000 \u2014 Jane Danson and Graham Norton\n*2001 \u2014 Claire Sweeney and John Altman\n*2002 \u2014 Charlotte Church and Scott Wright\n*2003 \u2014 Natasha Hamilton and Ronan Keating\n*2004 \u2014 Alex Best and Aled Haydn Jones\n*2005 \u2014 Nell McAndrew and Will Young\n*2006 \u2014 Javine Hylton and Ian Wright\n*2007 \u2014 Si\u00e2n Lloyd and Lee Mead\n*2008 \u2014 Jennifer Ellison and Ryan Thomas\n*2009 \u2014 Rachel Stevens and Russell Watson\n*2010 \u2014 Fiona Bruce and Ricky Whittle\n*2011 \u2014 Carol Vorderman and Anton Du Beke\n*2012 \u2014 Shobna Gulati and John Barrowman\n*2013 \u2014 Flavia Cacace and Vincent Simone\n*2014 \u2014 Carol Vorderman and Olly Murs\n*2015 \u2014 Kym Marsh and Daniel Radcliffe\n*2016 \u2014 Jennifer Metcalfe and Tom Hiddleston\nQuestion:\n\"Which TV presenter was the first to win the coveted \"\"Rear of the Year\"\" for a second time in 2014\"\nAnswer:\nCarol Vorderman\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nUnits of Measurement - University of North Carolina at ...\nUnits of Measurement\nA Dictionary of Units of Measurement\nFor information on a specific unit, click on the first          letter of its name:\nAnswers to the three most frequently asked          questions:\nHow many micrograms (\u00b5g, ug or mcg) in a          milligram (mg)?\n1000 micrograms = 1 milligram, and 1000 milligrams = 1          gram.\nHow can I convert from international units (IU)          to milligrams or micrograms?\nGenerally speaking, you can't. IU's measure the potency of a          drug, not its mass or weight.\nWhat countries besides the U.S. have not adopted the          metric system?\nMany U.S. teachers think the answer is \"Liberia and          Burma\" (make that Myanmar). Let's give Liberia and Myanmar a          break! All countries have adopted the metric system,          including the U.S., and most countries (but not the U.S.)          have taken steps to eliminate most uses of traditional          measurements. However, in nearly all countries people still          use traditional units sometimes, at least in colloquial          expressions. Becoming metric is not a one-time event that          has either happened or not. It is a process that happens          over time. Every country is somewhere in this process of          going metric, some much further along than others.\nCommentary and Explanation\nWire gauge table             (U.S./U.K.)\nIntroduction\nAmericans probably use a greater variety of units of measurement than anyone else in the world. Caught in a slow-moving transition from customary to metric units, we employ a fascinating and sometimes frustrating mixture of units in talking about the same things. We measure the length of a race in meters, but the length of the long jump event in feet and inches. We speak of an engine's power in horsepower and its displacement in liters. In the same dispatch, we describe a hurricane's wind speed in knots and its central pressure in millibars.\nFurthermore, our English customary units do not form a consistent system. Reflecting their diverse roots in Celtic, Roman, Saxon, and Norse cultures, they are often confusing and contradictory. There are two systems for land measurement (one based on the yard and the other on the rod) and a third system for distances at sea. There are two systems (avoirdupois and troy) for small weights and two more (based on the long and short tons) for large weights. Americans use two systems for volumes (one for dry commodities and one for liquids) and the British use a third (British Imperial Measure).\nMeanwhile, only a few Americans know that the legal definitions of the English customary units are actually based on metric units. The U. S. and British governments have agreed that a yard equals exactly 0.9144 meter and an avoirdupois pound equals exactly 0.453 592 37 kilograms. In this way, all the units of measurement Americans use every day are based on the standards of the metric system . Since 1875, in fact, the United States has subscribed to the International System of Weights and Measures , the official version of the metric system.\nThis dictionary began as a collection of notes describing the relationship between various English and metric units. It gradually grew until it finally became too large a word-processing document; I couldn't find my way around in it any more. So I turned it into a folder of html documents and added it to my Internet site. For many months, no one looked at the site except me and my students. Then, gradually, the dictionary began to attract users from around the world. Many users were kind enough to point out errors; others suggested additions and improvements. Questions about units began to appear in my email inbox. Sometimes I could answer the questions, sometimes not.\nToday the dictionary has become a kind of interactive resource. It grows slowly and steadily, mostly through suggestions from readers and my efforts to answer questions posed by readers. You can participate in this process! Please let me know if you find any errors on the site, or if you can't find what you wanted to know, or if you know of units used in your field of study or in your part of the world that aren't included.\nI hope you find the dictionary useful and informative.\nFormalities\nUniversity of North Carolina at    Chapel Hill .\nYou are welcome to email the author (rowlett@email.unc.edu) with comments and suggestions.\nAll material in this folder is copyright &COPY; 2005 by Russ Rowlett and the    University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
