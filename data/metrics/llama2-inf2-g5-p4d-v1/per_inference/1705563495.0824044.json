Buffett has said numerous times that he attributes much of his fame to this area. At the show, Jimmy commented about everyone wearing Hawaiian shirts and parrot hats and how they kept coming back to see his shows, just like Deadheads. Timothy B. Schmit, then a member of the Coral Reefer Band, coined the term \"Parrot Head\" to describe each of those fans.\n\nActivities\n\nEvents range from single act concerts or happy hours to the annual Meeting of the Minds in Key West, Florida, which attracts approximately 3,500 Parrotheads each year.  The several day event, sponsored by the Parrot Heads in Paradise includes live music, but also a Toy Drive for the Monroe County Salvation Army, a blood drive, Zonta Walk for Breast Cancer, raffles and other events to raise money for charities. Some regional groups will focus on one or two key charities, while others may switch between several.  Environmental causes, cancer research, Alzheimer's research and the March of Dimes all have received large donations from Parrothead organizations.  In 2011, there were 239 Parrothead Club chapters in the United States, Canada and Australia, spanning 3 different countries, 47 states and 3 Canadian provinces. The total membership in 2011 was almost 28,000 members. In the ten-year period 2002-2011, member clubs of the international Parrothead organization raised over $26.2M to support charitable organizations, and collectively worked almost 2.9 million hours of community service.  The Pikes Peak Hash House Harriers and Harriettes have an annual Parrot Head Hash weekend hosted by Yeastee Boy and Bread Box.\nQuestion:\nIf you were a parrothead, of what musician would you be a fan of?\nAnswer:\nJimmy buffett\nPassage:\nWhat Is A Dongle? - Business Insider\nWhat Is A Dongle? - Business Insider\nprint\n3 Dongles plugged into   Google's Chromebook Pixel. Kevin   Smith/Business Insider\nThis week two people in the tech industry lost their jobs because of jokes gone awry at a conference.\nA couple of male developers were joking around about \"big\"   dongles. When a female developer evangelist heard their jokes she   tweeted it out with their photo, complaining that they were being   rude. One of those developers lost his job, and then eventually,   so did the evangelist.\nIn the developers' defense, the word \"dongle\" is funny. It's   nearly impossible to say without giggling or making childish   jokes.\nSome people in our office had heard the word before, but didn't   know what a dongle is. Merriam-Webster \u00a0defines   a dongle\u00a0as a small device that plugs into a computer and   serves as an adapter or a security measure to enable the use of   certain software.\nKevin   Smith/Business Insider\nThe term, dongle, was rumored to have originated from a 1992   advertisement for Rainbow Technologies. The ad claimed the word   dongle was derived from the name \"Don Gall.\" Though untrue, this   has given rise to an urban myth, we learned from Wikipedia .\nAccording to the University of   Pennsylvania's language log , the earliest citation of the   word dongle began appearing in 1982:\n1982 \u00a0 MicroComputer   Printout \u00a0Jan. 19/2 The word \u2018dongle\u2019 has been   appearing in many articles with reference to security systems for   computer software [refers to alleged coinage in 1980].\nBut as the term 'dongle' became more widespread its meaning   changed from strictly a scientific term to mainstream. UPenn   clarifies:\nThe current meaning   for\u00a0dongle\u00a0seems   to be something like \"a self-contained device that plugs into   a\u00a0 port on a computer that is normally used for connections   to a separate external device\". Thus in addition to the original   serial-port dongles, and the USB dongles that Suzanne (and   Stephen Fry) wrote about, there are also\u00a0 \"firewire   dongles\" , and presumably there could be dongles for any   other sort of port as well.\u00a0\nSimply put, dongles are computer peripherals that plug into   your computer like a USB flash drive or a cord connecting a   computer with a printer for example.\u00a0 Dongles are also huge in the video game   world because they allow consoles to have added features like   increased audio quality.\nAn Xbox 360 Audio Dongle Wikimedia   Commons\nBefore USB was the standard in   attaching PC peripherals, there were tons of different dongles   that came in various shapes and sizes.\nQuestion:\nIn computing, what is the device which is plugged into a computer which serves as an adapter or to enable the use of certain software?\nAnswer:\nDongle\nPassage:\nEast Anglian Daily Times\nThe East Anglian Daily Times is a British local newspaper for Suffolk and Essex, based in Ipswich.\n\nIt started publication on 13 October 1874,  incorporating the Ipswich Express, which had been published since 13 August 1839.  The current editor is Terry Hunt.  \n\nThe East Anglian Daily Times merged news operations with the Ipswich Star in 2010, under the stewardship of chief executive of Archant Suffolk, Stuart McCreery.\n\nThe paper is published daily from Monday to Saturday in four regional editions: West Suffolk (around Bury St Edmunds), North Suffolk (around Lowestoft), East Suffolk (around Ipswich) and Essex (Colchester).  In the period December 2010-June 2011, it had an average daily circulation of 29,932. \n\nThe East Anglian Daily Times Company merged with Eastern Counties Newspapers in the 1960s; the group is now part of Archant.\nQuestion:\nIn which town or city is the East Anglian Daily Times published?\nAnswer:\nIpswich, UK\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nVelocity Definition in Physics\nVelocity Definition in Physics\nVelocity Definition in Physics\nVelocity Definition in Physics\nWhat Velocity Means and How To Calculate It\nVelocity is a measure of distance per unit time. It is a vector quantity, with both magnitude and direction.\u00a0 Mina De La O, Getty Images\nUpdated August 02, 2016.\nVelocity Definition\nVelocity is defined as a vector measurement of the rate and direction of motion or, in other terms, the rate and direction of the change in the position of an object. The scalar (absolute value) magnitude of the velocity vector is the speed of the motion. In calculus terms, velocity is the first derivative of position with respect to time.\nThe most common way to calculate the constant velocity of an object moving in a straight line is with the formula:\nr = d / t\nwhere\nr is the rate, or speed (sometimes denoted as v, for velocity, as in this kinematics article )\nd is the distance moved\nt is the time it takes to complete the movement\nUnits of Velocity\nThe SI units for velocity are m / s (meters per second). It may be expressed in any units of distance per time. Other units include miles per hour (mph), kilometers per hour (kph), and kilometers per second (km/s).\nSample Velocity Problem\nA physics student drops an egg off an extremely tall building.\ncontinue reading below our video\n4 Tips for Improving Test Performance\nWhat is the egg's velocity after 2.60 seconds?\nThe hardest part about solving for velocity in a physics problem is selecting the right equation. In this case, two equations may be used to solve the problem.\nUsing the equation:\nd = vI*t + 0.5*a*t2\nwhere d is distance, vI is initial velocity, t is time, a is acceleration (due to gravity, in this case)\nd = (0 m/s)*(2.60 s) + 0.5*(-9.8 m/s2)(2.60 s)2\nd = -33.1 m (negative sign indicates direction downward)\nNext, you can plug in this distance value to solve for velocity using the equation:\nvf = vi + a*t\nwhere vf is final velocity, vi is initial velocity, a is acceleration, and t is time. Since the egg was dropped and not thrown, the initial velocity is 0.\nvf = 0 + (-9.8 m/s2)(2.60 s)\nvf = -25.5 m/s\nAlthough it's common to report velocity as a simple value, remember it's a vector and has direction as well as magnitude. Usually, moving upward is indicated with a positive sign, and down carries a negative sign.\nRelating Velocity, Speed, and Acceleration\nSpeed, velocity, and acceleration are all related to each other. Remember:\nSpeed is a scalar quantity that indicates rate of motion distance per time. Its units are length/time.\nVelocity is a vector quantity that indicates distance per time and direction. Like speed, its units are length/time, but direction is also cited.\nAcceleration is a vector quantity that indicates the rate of change of velocity. It has dimensions of length/time2.\nQuestion:\nIn physics, 'the rate of change of position' is a basic definition of what term?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
