Pope John Paul II flew to this airport during his last visit to Cuba, flying a round trip between here and Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport in Havana. Likewise, Pope Benedict XVI, during the second papal visit to Cuba, flew here for Mass and other activities, from his visit to Le\u00f3n and Guanajuato in Mexico, before moving on to Havana.\nThe airport is basically a turbo-prop centre. Nevertheless, jet aircraft also fly to this airport. Most commercial flights into SCU are domestic, but there are about twenty international flights each week; while these international flights were at one point done mostly by domestic airlines, the international routes have nevertheless awakened the interest of some foreign airlines that have opened flights into this airport and might open more flights in the future.\n\nAirlines and destinations\nSantiago de Cuba Base\nThe airport was home to the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces:\n\n35th Transport Regiment - Antonov An-2 and Antonov An-26 transports\n36th Helicopter Regiment - Mil Mi-8 and Mil Mi-24The helipads are now part of the executive jet terminal on the north end of the airport.\n\nAccidents and incidents\nOn 2 October 1959, a Viscount of Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n was hijacked on a flight from Havana to Antonio Maceo Airport, Santiago de Cuba by three men demanding to be taken to the United States.

At that time there were 71 aircraft based at this airport: 89% single-engine, 4% multi-engine, 1% helicopter, 3% glider, and 3% ultralight.The facility was designed by aeronautical engineer Sam Ramsey, who resided at the sleepy airport for years prior to the development. He envisioned an airport where pilots could commute to Los Angeles while enjoying the quiet High Desert as a residence.\n\nSee also\nList of airports in Kern County, California\nPassage 3:\nAmpanihy Airport\nAmpanihy Airport (IATA: AMP, ICAO: FMSY) is an airport located in Ampanihy, Madagascar.\n\nAirlines and destinations\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPassage 4:\nCrow Island Airport\nCrow Island Airport (also known as Crow Island Airpark) is a private airport along the Assabet River in Stow, Massachusetts, United States.

A large amount of high octane fuel was captured and used by the Australians for use in the Royal Australian Navy motor launch boats. The airfield was repaired and used by the Royal Australian Air Force until the end of the war.\nPost WW2 in 1947, the Department of Civil Aviation sent an airport manager to Madang to oversee the building of the airport. Accommodation for the workers also had to be built as well as airplane hangars and a control tower. Wooden floors on concrete slabs were laid. Knitted woven bark for the walls was floated downstream, made by the natives, who were paid in cash. When the bark hut accommodation was ready, motor mechanics, radio technicians and other workers arrived along with wives and children. Eventually packaged Hawksley houses arrived from Britain and were built in the township of Madang.\n\nRoyal Australian Air Force Units at Madang\nHeadquarters, RAAF Northern Command (NORCOM)\nNo. 4 Squadron RAAF (CAC Boomerang)\nNo. 8 Communication Unit RAAF\nNo. 15 Squadron RAAF (Bristol Beaufort)\nNo. 111 Air-Sea Rescue Flight RAAF (PBY Catalina)\nNo. 120 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron RAAF\nNo. 2 Medical Receiving Station RAAF\nNo. 109 Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters RAAF\n\nAccidents and incidents\nOn 11 April 1972, Douglas C-47 VH-PNB of Trans Australia Airlines overran the runway on landing, ending up in the sea damaged beyond economic repair.\nOn 17 July 1972, Douglas C-47A VH-MAE of Ansett Airlines of Papua New Guinea was damaged beyond economic repair when the starboard undercarriage collapsed on landing.

Located about 3 miles (4.8 km) northeast of Downtown Cedar Park, it covers 25 acres (10.1 ha) and has one runway. It serves as the base for the fly-in community Breakaway Park.\n\nHistory\nFounding\nIn 1977, United States Marine Corps veteran and amateur pilot Walter Yates purchased land for the purpose of establishing a fly-in community. This land would become Breakaway Park, a subdivision of the City of Cedar Park that featured a 3,000 foot (914.4 m) grass runway at its center. Initially, Breakaway would consist of the single unpaved runway and a handful of hangars near its northern end, but would see continuous development that continues to the present day. The subdivision would be managed by Breakaway Park, Incorporated, of which Yates was the president until the company's dissolution on March 26, 2001.\n\nModern History\nOn January 1, 2008, Breakaway Park fell under the management of residents Donald Richie and Dennis Gale, operating as D&D Airport Holdings LLC.\n\nRunway Resurfacing\nOver the years 2014 and 2015, Breakaway's grass runway would be paved over with asphalt, but its length and width would remain unchanged.\n\nName Change\nIn 2014, Breakaway Airport's name would be changed to Hank Sasser/Breakaway Airport in honor of amateur pilot John Henry \"Hank\" Sasser. He was a Cedar Park native that operated his personal aircraft out of Breakaway, and died in an airplane crash in Lago Vista, Texas on August 23, 2014.\n\nFacilities\nBreakaway Airport offers fuel and oxygen services to residents of Breakaway Park. There are no air traffic control facilities on-site.\n\nRunway and Hangars\nBreakaway Airport has one runway.
