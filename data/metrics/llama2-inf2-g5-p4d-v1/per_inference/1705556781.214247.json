The album was originally meant to be entitled Kissing the Beehive; however, due to possible copyright infringements in relation to Jonathan Carroll's 1997 novel of the same name, this title was changed. Singer and keyboardist Spencer Krug said that the band \"didn't know that was the title of a book... We might have to change it, but we might not. And we'll have to make it clear that it's not [named] after his book. It's a complicated situation.\" It had also been reported earlier by Blender that the record was entitled Pardon My Blues; however, on April 28, Sub Pop officially announced that the album's name would be At Mount Zoomer.\n\nAlbum overview\nThe band started playing new songs live that would end up on At Mount Zoomer as early as summer 2007. Among the first to be played were \"Language City\" and \"Fine Young Cannibals\".\nAccording to singer and guitarist Dan Boeckner, half of the album was recorded in Farnham, Quebec at Petite \u00c9glise, an old church that was converted to a recording studio by the band Arcade Fire for the production of their album Neon Bible. After touring the east coast in late 2007, Wolf Parade recorded the rest of At Mount Zoomer at MIXart Studios in Montreal, Quebec. Afterwards, the album was mixed at Arlen Thompson's sound studio, Mount Zoomer.The cover art for the album features the work of Matt Moroz and Elizabeth Huey, depicting a battle scene between the two artists.The track \"Call It a Ritual\" was released by the band on April 14, 2008.\n\nReception\nAt Mount Zoomer received positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the album holds a score of 78 out of 100 based on 28 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nWolf Parade \u2013 mixing, producing, \"overdubs and vocals recorded by\"\nHarris Newman \u2013 mastering\nArlen Thompson \u2013 recording (tracks 1, 2, 4, 6-8), \"one vocal recorded by\"\nDavid Ferry \u2013 recording (tracks 3, 5, 9)\nNick Petrowski \u2013 recording (tracks 3, 5, 9)\nDavid Smith \u2013 \"some vocals recorded by\"\nJace Lasek \u2013 \"some vocals recorded by\"\nElizabeth Huey \u2013 artwork\nMatt Moroz \u2013 artwork\nPassage 5:\nTear Ourselves Away\nTear Ourselves Away is the first full-length LP by San Francisco-based indie rock band LoveLikeFire.

Blow in the Wind features several tracks which are led off with musical mash-ups of, or homages to, classic Punk songs, a trend the group began on their second album, Are a Drag (with an appropriation of \"Generator\" by Bad Religion for their cover of \"My Favorite Things\") and would continue with Take a Break and Ruin Jonny's Bar Mitzvah: \"Sloop John B\" samples \"Teenage Lobotomy\" by The Ramones, \"Elenor\" samples \"London Calling\" by The Clash, \"San Francisco\" samples \"Stranger Than Fiction\" by Bad Religion, \"I Only Want to Be With You\" samples and \"The Money Will Roll Right In\" by Fang. Similarly, the track \"Different Drum\" also ends with a guitar riff taken from \"Georgy Girl\" by the Seekers.\nThe first song begins with a clip similar to the hidden track on the NOFX album Punk in Drublic where Fat Mike attempts to find the proper pitch of the word \"how\" in the line \"How did the cat get so fat?\" from \"Perfect Government\".\nThe album is made up entirely of \"Hits of the 1960s\". The band's version of \"Different Drum\" can be heard during the credits of the film Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.\nThe band's version of \"Sloop John B\" is featured in the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nSpike Slawson - vocals\nChris Shiflett (a.k.a.
