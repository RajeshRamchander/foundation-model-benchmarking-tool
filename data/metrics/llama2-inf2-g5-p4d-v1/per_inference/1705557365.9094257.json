Here he also made religious profession, first as a teacher and later as prior. He first held the office of precentor of the Diocese of Norwich from about 1136, and was subsequently Prior of Norwich.Turbeville was present at the Easter synod of 1144 when Godwin Stuart alleged that his nephew, William of Norwich, a boy of about twelve years, had been murdered by the Norwich Jews during the preceding Holy Week.\nWhen Turbeville became bishop in 1146 or early 1147 he propagated the cult of the \"boy-martyr\". On four occasions he had the boy's remains transferred to more honourable places, and in 1168 erected a chapel in his honour in Mousehold Wood, where the boy's body was said to have been found. He persuaded Thomas of Monmouth, a monk of Norwich priory, to write \"The Life and Miracles of St William of Norwich\" about 1173, the only extant authority for the legend of William, which is now commonly discredited.\nTurbeville attended the Council of Rheims in 1148.Turbeville died on 16 January 1174 or 17 January 1174.\n\nCitations\nPassage 2:\nWilliam Scott, Lord Balwearie\nSir William Scott, Lord Balwearie (died 1532), or William Scot, was a Scottish judge.\n\nBiography\nScott was elder son of Sir William Scott of Balwearie, by Isobel, daughter of Sir John Moncrieff of Moncrieff. He accompanied James IV in his expedition into England in 1513, and, being taken prisoner at the battle of Flodden, was obliged to sell a portion of his lands of Strathmiglo to purchase his ransom. In February 1524 he was chosen a commissioner to parliament, when he was appointed one of the lords of the articles for the barons, an honour frequently afterwards conferred on him, although obtained by no one else under the rank of a peer. On 24 November he was styled a justice, in the absence of the justice-general, in a commission appointed to do justice on the \"malt makers of Leith for common oppression through the exorbitant dearth raised by them, and of their causing through the whole realm\". On the institution of the college of justice on 13 May 1532, he was nominated the first justice on the temporal side, but died before 19 November of the same year. \nBy his wife, Janet Lundy, daughter of Thomas Lundy of Lundy, he had two sons, Sir William, father of Sir James Scott (fl. 1579\u20131606), and Thomas (1480?\u20131539).\nPassage 3:\nErich Haenisch\nErich Haenisch  (27 August 1880, Berlin \u2013 21 December 1966, Stuttgart)  was a German sinologist and first-degree cousin of politician Konrad Haenisch. He was the academic teacher of George Kennedy (Yale).\nDuring World War II., Haenisch was the only German sinologist who actively intervened with the Nazi government on behalf of his colleague Henri Maspero, who had been arrested by the Gestapo and taken to Buchenwald, since his son was a member of the resistance. Since Haenisch did not receive support by his German colleagues, he could not save Maspero, who died in Buchenwald on March 17, 1945.\n\nExternal links\nErich Haenisch: Sinological Profiles, University of Massachusetts\nLiterature by and about Erich Haenisch in the German National Library catalogue\nPassage 4:\nWilliam Lamb alias Paniter\nWilliam Lamb, or William Paniter alias Lamb, (c. 1493 - 1550) was a Scottish cleric, lawyer, and author.\n\nLife\nWilliam Lamb was the son of a sister of Patrick Paniter, and a cousin of David Panter. In his early career he adopted his uncle Patrick Paniter's name. His clerical appointments included the Prebendaries of Conveth and Croy, rectory of Kinnell, and canon of Moray. He was enrolled as Master of Arts at St Andrews University in 1520.\nOn 25 February 1537, James V of Scotland ordered the Court of Session to admit William to sit in daily at their proceedings to learn their legal practices. He became a Senator of the College of Justice.\n\nAne Resonyng\nWilliam Lamb wrote Ane Resonyng of ane Scottis and Inglis merchand betuix Rowand and Lionis in 1549. It was an answer to English propaganda published during the war of the Rough Wooing. Unlike the Complaynt of Scotland (Paris, 1549), Lamb's book was not published but survived in manuscript.\nThe arguments are set out as a dialogue between a Scot and an Englishmen who meet while travelling in France, with an appearance from Thomas More, John Fisher and Richard Reynolds of Sion, three English Catholic martyrs.\n\nFootnotes\n\nLyall, Roderick J, ed., William Lamb - \"Ane Resonyng\" (Aberdeen University Press, 1985).\nPassage 5:\nWilliam Pooley\nSir William Pooley (died 5 August 1629) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1621 and 1629.\nPooley was of Boxted, Suffolk and was knighted by James I. In 1621, he was elected Member of Parliament for Preston. He was elected MP for both Preston and Sudbury in 1624 and chose to sit for Sudbury. In 1626 he was elected MP for Wigan. He was elected MP for Sudbury again in 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament, and then did so for eleven years.His daughter Judith married Sir Humphrey May.\nPassage 6:\nWilliam of March\nWilliam of March (or William March; died 1302) was a medieval Treasurer of England and a Bishop of Bath and Wells.\n\nLife\nWilliam was always referred to as magister, and may have attended and graduated from Oxford University. He was controller of the wardrobe from 1283 to 1290 and Dean of St. Martin's-le-Grand before being selected as Treasurer in August 1290. He was Treasurer until he was dismissed in August 1295. While treasurer, he introduced the practice of keeping Exchequer Journal rolls, or as accountants know them day books, which recorded the total amount in the treasury at the start of each day along with all payments made that day. This practice began in 1293, and did not record any payments made before taxes arrived at the treasury.William was a canon of Wells by 20 March 1291 and a royal clerk.William was elected bishop on 30 January 1293 and consecrated on 17 May 1293. As treasurer he was instrumental in putting forward administrative changes in the way the department was run. For the first time, monies coming into the treasury were recorded on special accounts and the officials of the department became more involved in the collection and assessment of taxes and other varieties of income. However, in August 1295 William was dismissed as treasurer, although the financial policies did not change. It may be that King Edward I used March as a scapegoat, or it may be that some charges that citizens of London brought against the treasurer were felt to be valid. After his dismissal from the treasurership in 1295, he devoted himself to the care of his diocese, and was regarded as a pious bishop.William died on 11 June 1302 although current historical research is challenging that date. He was buried at Wells Cathedral in the south transept wall on 17 June 1302. In 1325 there was a petition for him to be canonized, which continued to be supported by kings Edward II and Edward III. William is supposed to have built the chapter house at Wells. His will named a brother, John March, and a nephew, Robert Urry, to whom William left monies to go on crusade in William's name.\n\nCitations\nPassage 7:\nWilliam Middleton (bishop)\nWilliam Middleton (or William de Middleton; died 31 August or 1 September 1288) was a medieval Bishop of Norwich.\n\nLife\nMiddleton began his career as a clerk in the Jewish exchequer in 1265. He was given custody of the rolls in 1276, and in 1277 was at the French royal court. He was an official of Canterbury when he was appointed Archdeacon of Canterbury by Archbishop Robert Kilwardby in October 1275. He may also have held a prebend in the diocese of London.Middleton was elected on 24 February 1278 and was consecrated on 29 May 1278. He was enthroned at Norwich Cathedral on 27 November 1278. He continued to work on royal administrative business after his election and consecration.In July 1287 Middleton was appointed to the offices of Seneschal of Gascony and Lieutenant of the Duchy of Aquitaine. He died 31 August or 1 September 1288.\n\nCitations\nPassage 8:\nWilliam of St. Barbara\nWilliam of St. Barbara or William of Ste Barbe (died 1152) was a medieval Bishop of Durham.\n\nLife\nFrom William's name, it is presumed that he was a native of Sainte-Barbe-en-Auge in Calvados in Normandy (Neustria). He was a canon of York Minster in 1128. He was Dean of York by December 1138.William was elected to the see of Durham on 14 March 1143 and consecrated on 20 June 1143. He was elected in opposition to William Cumin who had been intruded into the see by King David I of Scotland in 1141. Cumin was never consecrated and by 1143 had been excommunicated by Pope Innocent II who also ordered a new election to be held at York Minster. It was this election which selected William of St. Barbara. However, the new bishop was not able to enter Durham right away, and he was enthroned either on 18 October 1144 or shortly thereafter.Troubles continued in Durham, and the bishop was unable to attend the Council of Rheims in 1148, which led to a suspension by the pope for inattendance. William supported Henry Murdac in the disputed election to the archbishopric of York, and it was probably Murdac who arranged for the suspension to be lifted. William also supported the Cistercians and the Augustinians, which perturbed  his cathedral chapter which was made up of Benedictine monks. He died 13 November 1152. A grave identified as his was excavated in the 19th century in the chapter house of  Durham Cathedral.\n\nCitations\nPassage 9:\nW. Langdon Kihn\nWilfred (or William) Langdon Kihn (September 5, 1898 \u2013 December 12, 1957) was a portrait painter and illustrator specializing in portraits of American Indians.\n\nLife and career\nHe was born in Brooklyn, New York, son of Alfred Charles Kihn and Carrie Lowe (Peck) Kihn.  He attended Boys' High School in Brooklyn and was recognized there for his artistic talent.He married Helen Van Tine Butler in 1920, and lived in Hadlyme and Moodus, Connecticut.He studied with the Art Students League, 1916\u201317, and was a pupil of Homer Boss and Winold Reiss.\n\nMotivated by a desire to document the disappearing aboriginal culture, he spent many years visiting and living with Indian tribes in the Western United States.  In 1920, he was admitted to the Blackfeet tribe in Montana, under the name \"Zoi-och-ka-tsai-ya,\" meaning \"Chase Enemy in Water\".In 1922, the New York Times described his work as follows:\n\nMr. Kihn's portraits are marvels of incisive characterization. These closely studied physiognomies show no trace of the sentimental idealization from which most painters of Indian subjects find it almost impossible to escape. Each is firm, clear, and direct, recording the subtle differences of aspect difficult enough to discern in races other than our own, and seizing the essential message of the face with youthful certainty and conviction.\nThroughout his career, he also illustrated a number of books, including Indian Days in the Canadian Rockies by Marius Barbeau (1923) and Pocahontas and Her World by Frances Carpenter (1961). Many of his illustrations featured colorful portraits, while children's story books such as Flat Tail by Alice Gall and Fleming Crew (1935) often featured line drawings.\nAlong with writer Donald Barr Chidsey, he was a Democratic candidate for the Connecticut House of Representatives from the town of Lyme, in the November 2, 1948 election.He died in Lawrence Memorial Hospital, New London, Connecticut, after a short illness, and was buried in Cove Cemetery, Hadlyme, Connecticut.\n\nCollections and exhibitions\nHis paintings were featured in one-man and group exhibitions in many different museums and galleries, starting in the early 1920s.His work is in the permanent collections of, among others, the McCord Museum in Montreal, Quebec, and the Davison Art Center Gallery at Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut.In 2014, the Foosaner Art Museum at the Florida Institute of Technology hosted an exhibition of his works, featuring pictures from the Vancouver Art Gallery and the National Geographic Society and a private collector.\n\nSee also\nNative Americans in the United States: Depictions by Europeans and Americans\nNative Americans in popular culture\nElbridge Ayer Burbank\nGeorge Catlin\nSeth and Mary Eastman\nPaul Kane\nCharles Bird King\nJoseph Henry Sharp\nJohn Mix Stanley\n\nSources\nExternal links\n\nW.
