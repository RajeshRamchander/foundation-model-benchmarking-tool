For a regular skater (left foot in front) the board spins clockwise from the perspective of one behind the skater. Again, there is a kick as part of the ollie but unlike the kickflip it is directed forward and outwards away from the rider's toe side (diagonal), so that the last part of the foot to leave the board is the heel, hence the name.\n\nWhile the heelflip is similar to the ollie, it is not a direct variation of the ollie.  In performing a standard heelflip you will see the skateboarder: \n*Places his or her front foot behind or on the front bolts of the board and towards the heel-side edge of the board.\n*The skater pushes the ball of the back foot on the tail of the board slightly angled initiating the \"pop\" and a slight spin. \n*The rider's front foot is slid out diagonally in order to start the board rotating while the shoulders are centered over the board.\n*His or her feet are lifted out of the way so that their board can spin completely.\n*The rider catches their board and roll away. Skateboarders considered it good execution of the trick to stop the board's rotation with the feet in midair rather than to allow contact with the ground to stop the board.\n\nVariations\n\nVariations and extensions of the standard heelflip are very common - some of these are:\n\n*Double Heelflip, where the board flips twice before being caught.\n*Triple Heelflip, where the board flips three times before being caught.\n*Heelflip Body Varial,(not to be confused with the disco flip, in which a riders performs a sex change 180 while executing a Kickflip), where the skater does a backside 180 turn, while the board does not spin, but still flips.\n*Varial Heelflip, where the board does one heel flip, and spins 180 degrees frontside (frontside pop shove-it) at the same time.\n*Laser flip, a combination of the Frontside 360 pop shove-it and the Heelflip. The opposite of a 360 flip.\n*Late Front-Foot Heelflip, in which the tail is snapped and the ollie is pursued but, at the peak of the ollie the heel of the front foot pushes downward on the toe-side edge of the board causing it to rotate once.\n*Late Heelflip, in which the rider does an Ollie, and at the peak of their air they flick their back foot resulting in a Heelflip.\n*The Heelflip Grab, a variation on grabs where the rider flips the board and catches it with his hand rather than the feet. It was first done on a vertical ramp but now is very commonly seen done on launch ramps or other surfaces which can generate sufficient air time.\n*Inward Heelflip, a combination of the backside pop shove-it and the Heelflip, this trick is usually executed with the crossing of the skater's legs. The opposite of a Hardflip.\n*Bigspin Heel, the skaters body does a frontside 180 while their board does a laser flip.\nQuestion:\nHeel flip, kick flip, and ollie are tricks in which action sport?\nAnswer:\nTAK Skateboarding\nPassage:\nRacing Demon (play)\nRacing Demon is a 1990 play by English playwright David Hare. Part of a trio of plays about British institutions, it focuses on the Church of England, and tackles issues such as gay ordination, and the role of evangelism in inner-city communities. The play debuted at the National Theatre.\n\nAwards and nominations\n \n; Awards\n* 1990 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play\n; Nominations\n* 1996 Tony Award for Best Play\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the play \u201cRacing Demon\u201d?\nAnswer:\nDavid Hare\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nTerry Jacks\nTerrence Ross \"Terry\" Jacks (born March 29, 1944, Winnipeg, Manitoba) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, record producer and environmentalist, best known for his 1974 hit song \"Seasons in the Sun\".\n\nEarly life\n\nTerry Jacks was born and raised in Winnipeg. His family relocated to Vancouver in the early 1960s. Jacks took up guitar in his teens and at 18 formed a band called The Chessmen with guitarist Guy Sobell. The group had four top-ten hits in Vancouver between 1964 and 1966.\n\nFollowing The Chessmen, Terry and Susan Pesklevits (Susan Jacks), whom he later married, formed The Poppy Family along with Craig McCaw and Satwant Singh. They had several hits in Canada and internationally, their biggest being \"Which Way You Goin' Billy?\", which went to #1 in Canada and #2 on the Billboard charts in the U.S. The song was written and produced by Terry Jacks which earned him a Gold Leaf (Juno) award in 1970 for his production.\n\n\"Seasons in the Sun\"\n\nThe song \"Seasons in the Sun\", released in late 1973 on his own record label, Goldfish Records, became the largest-selling international single by a Canadian artist at that time, eventually selling 14 million copies worldwide. It earned Jacks two Juno Awards and became one of the biggest selling Canadian Singles of all time. \n\nThe song was based on Rod McKuen's 1965 re-write of \"Le moribond\", originally by Belgian singer Jacques Brel from 1962. For his version, Jacks made some modifications to the lyrics, which along with McKuen's, resulted in a work that bears little resemblance to Brel's original in tone, substance or poetry. In the United States,  in Great Britain  and in Germany,  it was released on Bell Records, and the song nonetheless went to #1 on the charts. In Canada it was released on his own label, Goldfish Records, distributed by London Records Canada. \n\nJacks later released \"If You Go Away\" (another McKuen adaptation of a Jacques Brel song entitled \"Ne Me Quitte Pas\"), which reached #8 in Great Britain and #24 in Germany, and a cover of Kevin Johnson's \"Rock 'N' Roll (I Gave You The Best Years Of My Life)\", both of which had more success in Canada but also made the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the U.S. He wrote and recorded a number of other songs and went on to produce many artists including The Beach Boys with a version of \"Seasons in the Sun\" shortly before his own, but that was never released. He also produced the singles  \"Crazy Talk\"   and \"There's Something I Like About That\"   for Chilliwack from their album Riding High.\n\nJacks produced two songs for Nana Mouskouri: \"Scarborough Fair\" and \"Loving Arms\" in 1976. He produced the Vancouver top 10 hit \"Country Boy Named Willy\" for \"SPRING\" on London Records (#38 Canada); And Valdy's original version of \"Rock and Roll Song\" (b/w sometime \"Sunday Morning\"). The record was scheduled for release on London Records but was re-recorded in L.A. with another producer when Valdy signed a recording contract.  He also spent a lot of time with Buddy Knox in the 1970s and produced a single for him with two songs: \"Me and You\" (written by Jacks) and the George Jones song \"White Lightnin'\". The single remains unreleased.  Jacks also went on to produce a number of other artists in the 1980s and 1990s including DOA who recorded a punk rock version of \"Where Evil Grows\". \n\nRecently\n\nIn 2011, Jacks' friend Al Jardine released a new version of \"Don't Fight The Sea\", recorded along with fellow Beach Boys Mike Love, Brian Wilson, Bruce Johnston and the late Carl Wilson, who sang part of the lead vocal. A limited edition white vinyl 45 was made and sold to benefit Japanese Tsunami victims.  His brand new album release, \"Starfish on the beach\" is a double CD of 40 of his favorite tracks, from the last 40 years, and features some of his biggest hits of the 70s and 80s. The package contains a 32-page booklet with never before seen photos and Terry's recollections of his musical journey. It is now available from www.regeneratorrecords.com and in select stores throughout Canada.\n\nFilm\n\nJacks has worked in documentary film and video, producing several shorts on environmental themes including The Faceless Ones, The Tragedy of Clearcutting, The Southern Chilcotin Mountains and The Warmth of Love (The Four Seasons of Sophie Thomas) with cinematographer Ian Hinkle.  The video production The Faceless Ones earned an Environmental Gold Award from the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. \n\nPersonal life\n\nIn the late 1970s, Jacks gradually withdrew from the music world. He had a daughter, born in 1985. In the 1980s Jacks became involved in the environmental movement, focusing on pulp mill pollution issues in Canada. His environmental work has earned him several awards including one from the United Nations Association of Canada and the Western Canada Wilderness Committee. He was awarded a lifetime achievement award  in 1997 for his work, as well as the Eugene Rogers Environmental Award. \n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\n* Seasons in the Sun (1974)\n* Y' Don't Fight the Sea (1975)\n* Pulse (1983)\n* Just Like That (1987)\n\nSingles\nQuestion:\nWhich song was a UK number one for Terry Jacks in 1974 and for Westlife in 1999?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
