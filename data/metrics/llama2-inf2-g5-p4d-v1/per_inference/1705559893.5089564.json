It depicts Jesus Christ on the cross in a darkened sky floating over a body of water complete with a boat and fishermen. Although it is a depiction of the crucifixion, it is devoid of nails, blood, and a crown of thorns, because, according to Dal\u00ed, he was convinced by a dream that these features would mar his depiction of Christ. Also in a dream, the importance of depicting Christ in the extreme angle evident in the painting was revealed to him.\n\nTitle\n\nThe painting is known as the Christ of Saint John of the Cross, because its design is based on a drawing by the 16th-century Spanish friar John of the Cross. The composition of Christ is also based on a triangle and circle (the triangle is formed by Christ's arms; the circle is formed by Christ's head). The triangle, since it has three sides, can be seen as a reference to the Trinity, and the circle may be an allusion to Platonic thought. The circle represents Unity: all things do exist in the \"three\" but in the four, merry they be. \n\nInspiration\n\nOn the bottom of his studies for the painting, Dal\u00ed explained its inspiration: \"In the first place, in 1950, I had a 'cosmic dream' in which I saw this image in colour and which in my dream represented the 'nucleus of the atom.'  This nucleus later took on a metaphysical sense; I considered it 'the very unity of the universe,' the Christ!\" \n\nIn order to create the figure of Christ, Dal\u00ed had Hollywood stuntman Russell Saunders suspended from an overhead gantry, so he could see how the body would appear from the desired angle  and also envisage the pull of gravity on the human body. The depicted body of water is the bay of Port Lligat, Dal\u00ed's residence at the time of the painting. \n\nHistory\n\nThe painting and intellectual property rights were acquired for Glasgow Corporation in the early 1950s by Tom Honeyman, then the Director of Glasgow Museums. Honeyman got the painting for \u00a38,200, a price considered high at the time although it was less than the \u00a312,000 catalogue price, and included the copyright, which has earned Glasgow Museums back the original cost many times over.\n\nThe purchase was controversial. A petition against the purchase, arguing that the money should be spent on exhibition space for local artists, was presented to the City Council by students at Glasgow School of Art.  The controversy caused Honeyman and Dal\u00ed to become friends, corresponding with each other for many years after the original events.\n\nThe painting first went on display at the city's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum on 23 June 1952. In 1961, a visitor attacked the painting with a stone and tore the canvas with his hands. It was successfully restored over several months by conservators at Kelvingrove and returned to public display.  In 1993, the painting was moved to the city's St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art, but returned to Kelvingrove for its reopening in July 2006. It won a poll to decide Scotland's favourite painting in 2006, with 29% of the vote. \n\nCritical reception\n\nThis painting has continued to generate controversy. At the time of its purchase by Honeyman, the verdict by Modern Art critics was that producing such a traditional painting was a stunt by an artist already famous for his surrealist art. In 2009 the Guardian art critic, Jonathan Jones, described it as \"kitsch and lurid,\" but noted that the painting was \"for better or worse, probably the most enduring vision of the crucifixion painted in the 20th century.\"\n\nIn May 2013, in BBC Radio 4's Great Lives, British poet John Cooper Clarke described this image as being utterly different from any other image of the crucifixion, as the angle of view conveys the hanging pain of this method of execution, whilst hiding the ordinarily clich\u00e9d facial expressions normally seen in such depictions. \n\nSpanish offer\n\nThe Spanish government is said to have offered \u00a380 million ($127 million USD) for the painting, but the offer was turned down.\nQuestion:\nWhich 20th century artist's works include 'Christ Of St. John Of The Cross' and 'Metamorphosis Of Narcissus'?\nAnswer:\nSalvador Felipe Jacinto DalA\nPassage:\nGreen Mountains\nThe Green Mountains are a mountain range in the U.S. state of Vermont. The range runs primarily south to north and extends approximately 250 mi from the border with Massachusetts to that with Quebec, Canada. The part of the range that is in Massachusetts is known as The Berkshires,  and the part in Quebec is called the Sutton Mountains, or Monts Sutton. \n\nAll mountains in Vermont are often referred to as the \"Green Mountains\". However, other ranges within Vermont, including the Taconics \u2014 in southwestern Vermont's extremity \u2014 and Northeastern Highlands, are not geologically part of the Green Mountains.\n\nPeaks\n\nThe best-known mountains \u2013 for reasons such as high elevation, ease of public access by road or trail (especially the Long Trail and Appalachian Trail), or with ski resorts or towns nearby \u2013 in the range include: \n*Mount Mansfield, 4393 ft, the highest point in Vermont\n*Killington Peak, 4235 ft\n*Mount Ellen, 4083 ft\n*Camel's Hump, 4083 ft\n*Mount Abraham, 4017 ft\n*Pico Peak, 3957 ft\n*Stratton Mountain, 3940 ft, the mountain at which the initial ideas of both the Long Trail and the Appalachian Trail were born\n*Jay Peak, 3862 ft, receives the most amount of snowfall on average in the eastern United States  \n*Bread Loaf Mountain, 3835 ft\n*Mount Wilson, 3780 ft\n*Glastenbury Mountain, 3748 ft\n\nThe Green Mountains are part of the Appalachian Mountains, a range that stretches from Quebec in the north to Alabama in the south.\n\nThe Green Mountains are part of the New England/Acadian forests ecoregion.\n\nThree peaks, Mount Mansfield, Camel's Hump, and Mount Abraham, support alpine vegetation.\n\nTourism\n\nSome of the mountains are developed for skiing and other snow-related activities. Others have hiking trails for use in summer.  Mansfield, Killington, Pico, and Ellen have downhill ski resorts on their slopes. All of the major peaks are traversed by the Long Trail, a wilderness hiking trail that runs from the southern to northern borders of the state and is overlapped by the Appalachian Trail for roughly  of its length.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Vermont Republic, also known as the Green Mountain Republic,  existed from 1777 to 1791, at which time Vermont became the 14th state.\n\nVermont not only takes its state nickname (\"The Green Mountain State\") from the mountains, it is named after them. The French Verts Monts is literally translated as \"Green Mountains\". This name was suggested in 1777 by Dr. Thomas Young, an American revolutionary and Boston Tea Party participant.  The University of Vermont and State Agricultural College is referred to as UVM, after the Latin Universitas Viridis Montis (University of the Green Mountains). \n\nGeology and physiography\n\nThe Green Mountains are a physiographic section of the larger New England province, which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian physiographic division. \n\nLemon Fair runs through the towns of Orwell, Sudbury, Shoreham, Bridport, and Cornwall, Vermont, before flowing into Otter Creek. The story is that its name derives from early English-speaking settlers' phonetic approximation of 'Les Monts Vert'.\nQuestion:\nWhich American state has the nickname the Green Mountain state?\nAnswer:\nSports in Vermont\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nMay Birthstone | Emerald - American Gem Society\nMay Birthstone\nMay Birthstone\nMay Birthstone\nMay birthdays fall right in the heart of spring, and the emerald is the perfect gem to symbolize and celebrate this month.
