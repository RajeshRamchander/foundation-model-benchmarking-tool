A blue floating ghost-like creature, Willo had a long pointed nose which caricatured that of Williams. The name refers to the ghostly light will-o'-the-wisp from folklore.\n* Arthur the caterpillar (as a gruff cockney).\n* Mavis Cruet (known by Arthur as Mave), a plump clumsy fairy with erratic magical powers.\n* Evil Edna, a witch in the form of a walking, talking television set who could zap people with her aerials.\n* Carwash, a snooty bespectacled cat with a character based on No\u00ebl Coward.\n* The Moog, a supposed \"dog\" who is unable to think for himself.\n* Twit, a small bird.\n* The Beast, who began life as the dim Prince Humbert The Handsome, who can't pronounce the letter r correctly; an unfortunate encounter with Edna ended up with his transformation into a hairy shambling creature. In this encounter, he crashed into Edna on his bicycle and called her, \"Vewy dangewous. And what a wotten pwogwamme.\" Edna replied, \"I'll 'wotten-pwogwamme' him!\" and transformed him into The Beast.\n\nOther recurring characters include:\n\n* Gnomes, one of which Mavis takes a liking to.\n* The Astrognats, explorers of space with a mushroom-shaped spaceship.\n* The Bookworm, a very clever intelligent worm who eats facts from books as a source of knowledge.\n* A regiment of toy soldiers.\n* A bat.\n\nThe series was written and directed by Nick Spargo and produced by Nicholas Cartoon Films in association with the BBC and Tellytales Enterprises. The character of Willo the Wisp originated in an educational animation created by Nick Spargo for British Gas plc in 1975 and the stories were set in Doyley Woods, a small beech wood in Oxfordshire, near the director's home.\n\nEach of the original 26 episodes lasted approximately 5 minutes and were broadcast at 5:35pm on BBC1, a tradition as short cartoons were usually shown on weekdays between the end of the main children's program for that afternoon, and the BBC Evening news at 5:40pm. The series was repeated on satellite channel Galaxy in 1989 and on Channel 4 during the early 1990s.\n\nEpisodes\n\n# The Bridegroom\n# Edna's Secret\n# Food For Thought\n# Holidays\n# The Dragon\n# The Wishbone\n# The Chrysalis\n# The Magnet\n# Wugged Wocks\n# The Flight of Mavis\n# The Thoughts of Moog\n# The Joys of Spring\n# Games With Edna\n# The Hot Hot Day\n# Halloween\n# The Gnome\n# Boring Old Edna\n# The 'You Know What'\n# The Bean-Stalk\n# Cats and Dogs\n# The Midas Touch\n# The Viqueen\n# The Potion\n# The Beauty Contest\n# Magic Golf\n# Christmas Box\n\nOn the Kult Kidz Gold DVD there was an extra video \"Do Not Touch\" which featured the last part of Cats and Dogs, where Evil Edna makes the screen black.\n\nCredits\n\n*The Voices of: Kenneth Williams\n*Music by: Tony Kinsey\n*Script and Direction: Nicholas Spargo\n*Animation: Ron Murdoch, Ted Percival, Mike Pocock\n*Devised and Designed by: Nick Spargo\n*Editor: Michael Crane\n*Backgrounds: Mary Spargo\n*Camera: Chris King\n*Production Assistant: Andrea Fontaine\n*Trace & Paint: Lynne Sachs & Ian Sachs\n*Produced by: Nicholas Cartoon Films Ltd\n*Processed by: Rank Film Laboratories Ltd\n\nSecond series (2005)\n\nA second series of 26 episodes (5 minutes each) was produced by Bobbie Spargo in 2005, and voiced by James Dreyfus. \nAlthough it maintains the style of the original, alterations include:\n*Willo no longer being a caricature of Williams.\n*Mavis being slimmer (although still too heavy to fly).\n*Evil Edna being a widescreen television, with a wheeled stand instead of the original's metal legs.\n\nThe second series aired on Playhouse Disney in the UK.\n\nEpisodes\n\n# Moon on a Stick  \n# The Toothache  \n# The Nature Walk  \n# Feed the Birds  \n# The Magic Bone  \n# The Knotted Handkerchief  \n# The Little Cloud  \n# The Mind Reader  \n# The Fancy Dress Ball  \n# Bowling for Carwash  \n# The Knee-Knocking Tree  \n# The Best Friend\n# The Tiddle Me Wink  \n# The Makeover \n# The Miracle \n# The Love Bug \n# The Wobbly Wood \n# The Doyley Hunt \n# The Cocoa Demon \n# The Beauty Spot \n# The Curse of Celebrity  \n# The Lost City of Polenta  \n# The Woodwind  \n# The Vegetable Garden  \n# The Art Class  \n# Here Comes the Judge\nQuestion:\nWhich late actor narrated the British children\u2019s television programme \u2018Willo the Wisp\u2019?\nAnswer:\nKenneth Williams\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nMay Birthstone | Emerald - American Gem Society\nMay Birthstone\nMay Birthstone\nMay Birthstone\nMay birthdays fall right in the heart of spring, and the emerald is the perfect gem to symbolize and celebrate this month.
