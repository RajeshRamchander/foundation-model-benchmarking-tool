The song became the group's international breakthrough single, receiving recognition around the world. It was their first Top 10 hit on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 10. The song also  peaked at number 11 in Australia, and achieved success in Japan and America. \n\nThe song was written by frontman Fran Healy who wrote the song while on holiday in Israel. He wanted to go somewhere sunny because in his hometown of Glasgow it rained all the time. In an interview at the Live 8 concert, he explained that he was spending a short holiday in the southern vacation city of Eilat, Israel in the middle of the winter.  The city is known for its hot weather even during winter time, but surprisingly it began to rain for two days during his stay. \n\nWhen Travis began to perform this song at the 1999 Glastonbury Festival, after being sunny for several hours, it began to rain exactly when the first line was sung.\n\nIn a poll by listeners of Absolute Radio the song was ranked 39th on a list of the top 100 songs of the 1990s.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe music video was directed by John Hardwick and filmed in Cornwall, with scenes filmed on Craddock Moor. The pool of water that the band jump into is part of a disused mining quarry known locally as \"Gold Digger's Mine\". The video features the band in a rain-soaked setting, with the band having locked frontman Healy, wearing a kilt, in the boot of a 1970s Vauxhall Viva. Healy escapes, and chases the rest of the band into a disused mining quarry. The video continues with the band being shown in a floating living room, performing the song. The video ends with the living room floating away. It does not actually rain at any point during the video.\n\nTrack listing\n\n* UK CD1\n# \"Why Does It Always Rain on Me?\" \u2013 4:27\n# \"Village Man\" \u2013 3:18\n# \"Driftwood\" (live at the Link Caf\u00e9, Glasgow) \u2013 4:07\n\n* UK CD2\n# \"Why Does It Always Rain on Me?\" \u2013 4:27\n# \"The Urge for Going\" \u2013 6:04\n# \"Slide Show\" (live at the Link Caf\u00e9, Glasgow) \u2013 3:15\n\n* 7\" vinyl / Cassette / European single\n# \"Why Does It Always Rain on Me?\" \u2013 4:27\n# \"Village Man\" \u2013 3:18\n\n* American EP\n# \"Why Does It Always Rain on Me?\" \u2013 4:27\n# \"Village Man\" - 3:18\n# \"The Urge for Going\" \u2013 6:04\n# \"Driftwood\" (live at the Link Caf\u00e9, Glasgow) \u2013 4:07\n# \"Slide Show\" (live at the Link Caf\u00e9, Glasgow) \u2013 3:15\n\n* Australian single\n# \"Why Does It Always Rain on Me?\" \u2013 4:27\n# \"Village Man\" \u2013 3:18\n# \"Driftwood\" (live at the Link Caf\u00e9, Glasgow) \u2013 4:07\n# \"Baby One More Time\" (live at the Bay Tavern, Robin Hood's Bay) \u2013 3:30\n# \"Why Does It Always Rain on Me?\" (video)\n\nCharts\nQuestion:\nWhich group had a top ten hit with the song 'Why Does It Always Rain On Me'?\nAnswer:\nTravis\nPassage:\nPravastatin\nPravastatin (marketed as Pravachol or Selektine) is a member of the drug class of statins, used in combination with diet, exercise, and weight loss for lowering cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular disease.\n\nMedical uses\n\nPravastatin is primarily used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. It is recommended to be used only after other measures, such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction, have not improved cholesterol levels.\n\nThe evidence for the use of pravastatin is generally weaker than for other statins. The antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment to prevent heart attack trial (ALLHAT), failed to demonstrate a difference in all-cause mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction/fatal coronary heart disease rates between patients receiving pravastatin 40 mg daily (a common starting dose) and those receiving usual care. \n\nAdverse effects and contraindications\n\nPravastatin has undergone over 112,000 patient-years of double-blind, randomized trials using the 40-mg, once-daily dose and placebos. These trials indicate pravastatin is well tolerated and displays few noncardiovascular abnormalities in patients.   However, side effects may occur. A doctor should be consulted if symptoms such as heartburn or headache are severe and do not go away.\n\nThese uncommon side effects should be promptly reported to the prescribing doctor or an emergency medical service: \n* muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness\n* lack of energy\n* fever\n* jaundice, yellowing of the skin or eyes\n* pain in the upper right part of the stomach\n* nausea\n* extreme tiredness\n* unusual bleeding or bruising\n* dark-colored urine\n* loss of appetite\n* flu-like symptoms\n* rash\n* hives\n* itching\n* difficulty breathing or swallowing\n* swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs\n* hoarseness\n\nThese symptoms should be reported to the prescribing doctor if they persist or increase in severity:\n* heartburn\n* headache\n* memory loss or forgetfulness\n* confusion\n\nContraindications, conditions that warrant withholding treatment with pravastatin, include pregnancy and breastfeeding. Taking pravastatin while pregnant could lead to birth defects. While the amount of pravastatin ingested by an infant from breastfeeding is low, patients breastfeeding should not take pravastatin due to potential effects on the infant's lipid metabolism.\n\nDrug interactions\n\nMedications that should not be taken with pravastatin include, but are not limited to:\n* Cimetidine (Tagamet) \n* Colchicine (Colcrys)\n* Cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune)\n* Ketoconazole (Nizoral)\n* Additional cholesterol-lowering medications such as: fenofibrate (Tricor), gemfibrozil (Lopid), cholestyramine (Questran, Questran Light, Cholybar), and niacin (nicotinic acid, Niacor, Niaspan);\n* Specific HIV protease inhibitors such as: lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra), and ritonavir (Norvir) taken with darunavir (Prezista); and spironolactone (Aldactone).\n\nPravastatin is cleared by the kidney, giving it a distinct advantage over other statins when a potential for drug interactions using the hepatic pathway exists.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nPravastatin acts as a lipoprotein-lowering drug through two pathways. In the major pathway, pravastatin inhibits the function of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. As a reversible competitive inhibitor, pravastatin sterically hinders the action of HMG-CoA reductase by occupying the active site of the enzyme. Taking place primarily in the liver, this enzyme is responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate in the rate-limiting step of the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol. Pravastatin also inhibits the synthesis of very-low-density lipoproteins, which are the precursor to low-density lipoproteins (LDL). These reductions increase the number of cellular LDL receptors, thus LDL uptake increases, removing it from the bloodstream.  Overall, the result is a reduction in circulating cholesterol and LDL. A minor reduction in triglycerides and an increase in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are common.\n\nHistory\n\nInitially known as CS-514, pravastatin is a derivative of ML236B (compactin), which was identified in a fungus called Penicillium citrinum in the 1970s by researchers of the Sankyo Pharma Inc.Jonathan A. Tobert  [http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v2/n7/full/nrd1112.html Lovastatin and beyond: the history of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors] Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2, 517-526 (July 2003) PMID 12815379  It is being marketed outside Japan by the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb. In 2005, Pravachol was the 22nd-highest selling brand-name drug in the United States, with sales totaling $1.3 billion. \n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved generic pravastatin for sale in the United States for the first time on April 24, 2006. Generic pravastatin sodium tablets are manufactured by Biocon Ltd, India and TEVA Pharmaceuticals in Kfar Sava, Israel.\nQuestion:\nPravachol, Lipitor, Mevacor, Altocor, and Zocor are brands of what $multi-billion cholesterol controlling drug, ultimately named after Greek meaning 'causing to stand'?\nAnswer:\nCholesterol Reduction\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nGORDON JACKSON, 66; WAS BUTLER IN SERIES 'UPSTAIRS ...\nGORDON JACKSON, 66; WAS BUTLER IN SERIES 'UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS' - The Boston Globe (Boston, MA) | HighBeam Research\nAPA\nAssociated Press. \"GORDON JACKSON, 66; WAS BUTLER IN SERIES 'UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS'.\" The Boston Globe (Boston, MA).
