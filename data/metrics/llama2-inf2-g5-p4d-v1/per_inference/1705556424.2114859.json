It is based on actual events and depicts the 185th Airborne Division Folgore during the battle of El-Alamein. The screenwriter and military advisor was Marcantonio Bragadin.\n\nPlot\nIn the summer of 1942, during the Second World War, a group of young paratroopers from the Folgore Division, after having undergone a long and tiring training in Italy, was transported by air to the Libyan desert to cover the Italian-German front. The young soldiers believe that their destination is the island of Malta (operation C3) or the area of Alexandria: instead they find themselves thrown into a desert region where they are forced to live in holes dug in the sand and to face with insufficient means the armored British armored units. They will sadly see their parachutes piled up inside a warehouse in the desert. Thus develops that epic fight, which takes the name of the battle of El-Alamein, in which a handful of heroic fighters try with every effort to stop or at least delay the advance of General Montgomery's British tanks. Once their line-up has broken through, the survivors resist for several days an unequal struggle against the preponderant English forces, even being mentioned, for their heroism, by the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who called them \"The lions of the Thunderbolt\".\n\nCast\nEttore Manni: The Captain\nFausto Tozzi: The Sergeant\nJos\u00e9 Jaspe: Salvi\nMarco Guglielmi: Lt.
