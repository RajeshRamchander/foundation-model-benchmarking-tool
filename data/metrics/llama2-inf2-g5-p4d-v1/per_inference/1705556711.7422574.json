Most of the major lakes in Africa lie along a continental fault line known as the East African Rift Valley, which runs through the southeastern portion of the continent, creating both spectacular mountains such as Kilimanjaro and a system of deep lakes known collectively as the Great Lakes of Africa. While not quite as large as the North American Great Lakes system, the system nonetheless looms significant in both the physical and economic geography of the continent -- and that's not to mention its physical beauty and stature.\nLake Victoria\nNot only is Lake Victoria the largest lake in Africa, it is the second-largest freshwater lake in terms of area in the world. Bordered by Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, it supports a diverse ecosystem of reefs and islands, including many unique species of fish. Lake Victoria is also one of the sources of the Nile River. The land around Lake Victoria is densely populated, and the lake plays an important economic role in the lives of the people there. For tourists, sport fishing for Nile perch is a major attraction, as is birdwatching.\nLake Tanganyika\nLake Tanganyika is one of the 10 largest freshwater lakes in the world and the second deepest. Long and narrow -- in fact, the longest lake in the world -- it forms the entirety of the border between Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and also borders Burundi to the north and Zambia to the south. The lake's warm blue waters make it especially attractive to swimmers; sport fishing is also a draw.\nLake Nyasa\nLike Lake Victoria, Lake Nyasa -- also known as Lake Malawi -- is part of the African Great Lakes system. It's the third-largest lake in the East African Rift Valley system, bordered by Malawi, Tanzania and Mozambique. Nyasa means \"lake\" in Bantu. The Malawi beaches are well-established tourist attractions, while Tanzanian beaches such as Matema Beach tend to be less developed.\nLake Albert\nLake Albert is also sometimes known as Lake Mobutu Sese Seko. The lake is relatively shallow, reaching only 80 feet in depth, but in terms of surface area it's the fourth largest of the Rift Valley lakes. Its significant also for acting as a source of the White Nile river. Lake Albert borders Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Due to the terrain, which includes steep surrounding mountains, the shores of Lake Albert are sparsely populated, and the area is off the beaten path in terms of tourism, but visitors might be interested in the wildlife and forest preserves that surround the lake, as well as Muchison Falls National Park.\nLake Chad\nLake Chad is northern Africa's largest lake in terms of area, but it is strikingly shallow, reaching only 34 feet at its deepest point. This is in part because Lake Chad is surrounded by the arid Sahara Desert. In fact, the exact dimensions of the lake can vary widely from year to year depending on the local drought conditions. Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria and Niger share a border with the lake. Lake Chad is a vital wildlife sanctuary, and birdwatchers will find much to occupy themselves here. The best time to visit is during the rainy season, roughly August to December, when the water level is high.\nReferences\nQuestion:\nWhich is the largest lake in Africa?\nAnswer:\nSouthern Victoria Nyanza\nPassage:\nBoy Scout Motto - U.S. Scouting Service Project\nBoy Scout Motto\nBoy Scout Motto\nBe Prepared: The Motto of the Boy Scouts of America\nExcerpted from page 54, Boy Scout Handbook, 11th ed,\n(#33105), copyright 1998 by BSA, ISBN 0-8395-3105-2\nBe Prepared.\nThat's the motto of the Boy Scouts.\n\"Be prepared for what?\" someone once asked Baden-Powell, the founder of     Scouting,\n\"Why, for any old thing.\" said Baden-Powell.\nThe training you receive in your troop will help you\u00a0 live up to the Scout motto.     When someone has an accident, you are prepared because of your first aid instruction.     Because of lifesaving practice, you might be able to save a nonswimmer who has fallen into     deep water.\nBut Baden-Powell wasn't thinking just of being ready for emergencies. His idea was that     all Scouts should prepare themselves to become productive citizens and to give happiness     to other people. He wanted each Scout to be ready in mind and body for any struggles, and     to meet with a strong heart whatever challenges might lie ahead.\nBe prepared for life - to live happily and without regret, knowing that you have     done your best. That's what the Scout motto means.\nPage updated on:   May 02, 2013\n\u00a9 1994-2017 - U.S. Scouting Service Project | Site Map | Disclaimer | Project Team | Contact Us | Privacy Policy\nMaterials found at U.
