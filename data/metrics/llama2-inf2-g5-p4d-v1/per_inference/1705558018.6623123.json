A 2002 article in the Village Voice by Ed Park said he might have been English by birth but was more probably American. The article said he might have served in the navy and that he has been incorrectly called a graduate of MIT. The article says that he attended a vocational high school attached to MIT in 1888 but there is no record that he graduated. Park said rumors that Wright died within hours of Gadsby being published are untrue. \n\nIn October 1930 Wright approached the Evening Independent newspaper and proposed it sponsor a blue lipogram writing competition, with $250 for the winner. In the letter, he boasted of the quality of Gadsby. The newspaper declined his offer. \n\nA 2007 post on the Bookride blog about rare books says Wright spent five and a half months writing Gadsby on a typewriter with the \"e\" key tied down. According to the unsigned entry at Bookride, a warehouse holding copies of Gadsby burned shortly after the book was printed, destroying \"most copies of the ill fated novel.\" The blog post says the book was never reviewed \"and only kept alive by the efforts of a few avant garde French intellos and assorted connoisseurs of the odd, weird and zany.\" The book's scarcity and oddness has seen copies priced at $4,000 by book dealers.[http://www.bookride.com/2007/02/gadsby-story-of-over-50000-words_24.html   Bookride blog] February 24, 2007.\n\nWright completed a draft of Gadsby in 1936, during a nearly six month stint at the National Military Home in California. He failed to find a publisher and used a self-publishing press to bring out the book.\n\nWright previously authored three other books: The Wonderful Fairies of the Sun (1896), The Fairies That Run the World and How They Do It (1903), and Thoughts and Reveries of an American Bluejacket (1918). His humorous poem, \"When Father Carves the Duck\", can be found in some anthologies.\nQuestion:\n\"Ernest Vincent Wright wrote a novel, \"\"Gadsby\"\", which contains over 50,000 words -- none of them with which letter?\"\nAnswer:\n\u24a0\nPassage:\nWilliam Holman Hunt\nWilliam Holman Hunt  (2 April 1827 \u2013 7 September 1910) was an English painter and one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.  His paintings were notable for their great attention to detail, vivid color, and elaborate symbolism.  These features were influenced by the writings of John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle, according to whom the world itself should be read as a system of visual signs.  For Hunt it was the duty of the artist to reveal the correspondence between sign and fact.  Of all the members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Hunt remained most true to their ideals throughout his career.  He was always keen to maximize the popular appeal and public visibility of his works. \n\nBiography\n\nWilliam Holman Hunt changed his middle name from \"Hobman\" to Holman when he discovered that a clerk had misspelled the name after his baptism at the church of Saint Mary the Virgin, Ewell.  After eventually entering the Royal Academy art schools, having initially been rejected, Hunt rebelled against the influence of its founder Sir Joshua Reynolds. He formed the Pre-Raphaelite movement in 1848, after meeting the poet and artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Along with John Everett Millais they sought to revitalise art by emphasising the detailed observation of the natural world in a spirit of quasi-religious devotion to truth. This religious approach was influenced by the spiritual qualities of medieval art, in opposition to the alleged rationalism of the Renaissance embodied by Raphael. He had many pupils including Robert Braithwaite Martineau.\n\nHunt married twice. After a failed engagement to his model Annie Miller, he married Fanny Waugh, who later modelled for the figure of Isabella. When she died in childbirth in Italy he sculpted her tomb at Fiesole, having it brought down to the English Cemetery, beside the tomb of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. He had a close connection with St. Mark's Church in Florence, and paid for a communion chalice inscribed in the memory of his wife. His second wife, Edith, was Fanny's sister. At this time it was illegal in Britain to marry one's deceased wife's sister, so Hunt was forced to travel abroad to marry her. This led to a serious breach with other family members, notably his former Pre-Raphaelite colleague Thomas Woolner, who had once been in love with Fanny and had married Alice, the third sister of Fanny and Edith.\n\nHunt's works were not initially successful, and were widely attacked in the art press for their alleged clumsiness and ugliness. He achieved some early note for his intensely naturalistic scenes of modern rural and urban life, such as The Hireling Shepherd and The Awakening Conscience. However, it was with his religious paintings that he became famous, initially The Light of the World (1851\u20131853), now in the chapel at Keble College, Oxford; a later version (1900) toured the world and now has its home in St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nIn the mid-1850s Hunt travelled to the Holy Land in search of accurate topographical and ethnographical material for further religious works, and to \u201cuse my powers to make more tangible Jesus Christ\u2019s history and teaching\u201d;  there he painted The Scapegoat, The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple and The Shadow of Death, along with many landscapes of the region. Hunt also painted many works based on poems, such as Isabella and The Lady of Shalott. He eventually built his own house in Jerusalem \n\nHe eventually had to give up painting because failing eyesight meant that he could not get the level of quality that he wanted. His last major works, a large version of The Light of the World were completed with the help of his assistant Edward Robert Hughes.\n\nHunt died on 7 September 1910 and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral \n\nAwards and commemoration\n\nHunt published an autobiography in 1905.  Many of his late writings are attempts to control the interpretation of his work. That year, he was appointed to the Order of Merit by King Edward VII. At the end of his life he lived in Sonning-on-Thames.\n\nHis personal life was the subject of Diana Holman-Hunt's book My Grandfather, his Life and Loves. \n\nThe Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was depicted in two BBC period dramas. The first, The Love School, in 1975, starred Bernard Lloyd as Hunt. The second was Desperate Romantics, in which Hunt is played by Rafe Spall. \n\nFacing Mar Elias Monastery is a stone bench erected by the wife of the painter, who painted some of his major works at this spot. The bench is inscribed with biblical verses in Hebrew, Greek, Arabic and English.\n\nPartial list of works\n\n*A Converted British Family Sheltering a Christian Missionary from the Persecution of the Druids (1850)\n*Valentine Rescuing Sylvia from Proteus (1851)\n*The Awakening Conscience (1853)\n*The Light of the World (1854)\n*The Scapegoat (1856)\n*The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple (1860)\n*The Shadow of Death (1871)\n*The Importunate Neighbour (1895)\n*The Miracle of the Holy Fire (1899)\n\nGallery\n\nFile:William Holman Hunt - Christ and the two Marys - Google Art Project.jpg|Christ and the two Marys (1847 & 1897)\nFile:William Holman Hunt 001.jpg|The Hireling Shepherd (1851)\nFile:William Holman Hunt - The Lantern Maker's Courtship, A Street Scene in Cairo - Google Art Project.jpg| The Lantern Maker's Courtship, A Street Scene in Cairo (1854\u201356)\nFile:William Holman Hunt - Portrait of Fanny Holman Hunt.jpg|Portrait of Fanny Holman Hunt, (1866\u201367)\nFile:Basilpot.jpg| Isabella and the Pot of Basil (1868)\nFile:William Holman Hunt - The Birthday.jpg| The Birthday (1868)\nFile:William Holman Hunt - Amaryllis.jpg|Amaryllis (1884)\n\nFile:Holman-Hunt, William, and Hughes, Edward Robert - The Lady of Shalott - 1905.jpg| The Lady of Shalott (1905)\nQuestion:\nWhat is the title of the painting by William Holman Hunt which features an animal with a red cloth wrapped around its horns on the Day of Atonement?\nAnswer:\nThe Scapegoat (film)\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nKing George II - Britroyals.com\nKing George II | Britroyals\nBorn: October 30, 1683 at  Herrenhausen, Hanover\nParents: George I and Sophia Dorothea\nRelation to Elizabeth II: 5th great-grandfather\nHouse of: Hanover\nAscended to the throne: June 11, 1727 aged 43 years\nCrowned: October 11, 1727 at  Westminster Abbey\nMarried: Caroline, daughter of Margrave of Brandenburg\nChildren: Four sons and five daughters\nDied: October 25, 1760 at  Kensington Palace, aged 76 years, 11 months,  and 25 days\nBuried at: Westminster\nReigned for: 33 years, 4 months,  and 15 days\nSucceeded by: his grandson George III\nGeorge II was born in Hanover the son of George I and Sophia of Celle.
