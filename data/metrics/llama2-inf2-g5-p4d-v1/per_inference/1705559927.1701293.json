It consists of a joint introductory paper (reprinted from 1893); followed by five individual studies of \"hysterics\" \u2013 Breuer's famous case of Anna O. (real name: Bertha Pappenheim), seminal for the development of psychoanalysis, and four more by Freud; and finishing with a theoretical essay by Breuer and a more practice-oriented one on therapy by Freud. \n\nSummary\n\nFreud sees symptomology as stratified in an almost geological way, with the outermost strata being easily remembered and accepted, while \u201cthe deeper one goes the more difficult it is to recognise the recollections that are surfacing\u201d. \n\nReception and influence\n\nBreuer's work with Bertha Pappenheim provided the founding impetus for psychoanalysis, as Freud himself would acknowledge.  In their preliminary (1893) paper, both men agreed that \u201cthe hysteric suffers mainly from reminiscences\u201d.  Freud however would come to lay more stress on the causative role of sexuality in producing hysteria, as well as gradually repudiating Breuer's use of hypnosis as a means of treatment.  Some of the theoretical scaffolding of the Studies \u2013 \"strangulated affect\", hypnoid state  \u2013 would be abandoned with the crystallisation of psychoanalysis as an independent technique.  However, many of Freud\u2019s clinical observations \u2013 on mnenmic symbols  or deferred action  for example \u2013 would continue to be confirmed in his later work. At the same time, Breuer\u2019s theoretical essay, with its examination of the principle of constancy, and its differentiation of bound and mobile cathexis,  would continue to inform Freud\u2019s thinking as late as the twenties and the writing of Beyond the Pleasure Principle.\n\nAt the time of its release, Studies on Hysteria tended to polarise opinion, both within and outside by the medical community.  While many were critical, Havelock Ellis offered an appreciative account, while a leading Viennese paper would characterise the work as \u201cthe kind of psychology used by poets\u201d.  Studies on Hysteria received a positive review from psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, although Bleuler nevertheless suggested that the results Freud and Breuer reported could have been the result of suggestion. Philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and psychologist Sonu Shamdasani comment that Studies on Hysteria gave Freud, \"a certain local and international notoriety\". Borch-Jacobsen and Shamdasani write that, contrary to what Freud and Breuer claimed, Freud \"always knew that the treatment of Bertha Pappenheim...had not been an unmitigated success\".\nQuestion:\n\"Who wrote the book \"\"Studies in Hysteria\"\" and \"\"Interpretation of Dreams\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nZigi Frojd\nPassage:\nHablot Knight Browne\nHablot Knight Browne (10 July 1815 \u2013 8 July 1882) was an English artist.  Well-known by his pen name, Phiz, he illustrated books by Charles Dickens, Charles Lever, and Harrison Ainsworth.\n\nBiography\n\nOf Huguenot ancestry, Hablot Knight Browne was born in England, in Lambeth (near London) on Kennington Lane.  He was the fourteenth of Catherine and William Loder Browne's fifteen children. According to Valerie Browne Lester, Phiz was in fact the illegitimate son of his putative eldest sister Kate and Captain Nicholas Hablot of Napoleon's Imperial Guard. There is some uncertainty regarding the exact date of birth. 10 July 1815 is the date given by Valerie Browne Lester, his great-great-granddaughter. John Buchanan-Brown in his book Phiz!: illustrator of Dickens' world says 12 July 1815. The date on his Christening record of 21 December 1815 at St Mary's Church, Lambeth, Surrey, England gives 11 June 1815, as does the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition and 15 June 1815 (Dictionary of National Biography). A copy of the program from his burial service, which is still owned by the Browne family, says he was born 10 July 1815. \n\nWhen he was 7 years old, his father William Browne abandoned his family, changed his name to Breton and sailed with embezzled funds to Philadelphia where he became known for his watercolour paintings. William Browne was then declared dead by his wife Catherine. \nThomas Moxon, husband of William's sister Ann Loder Browne, helped to support the family, who were left badly off.\n\nBrowne was apprenticed to William Finden, an engraver, in whose studio he obtained his only artistic education. However, he was unsuited for engraving, and having during 1833 secured an important prize from the Society of Arts for a drawing of John Gilpin, he abandoned engraving in the following year and began other artistic work, with the ultimate object of becoming a painter.\n\nArtistic career\n\nIn the spring of 1836, he met Charles Dickens. It was at the time when Dickens was looking for someone to illustrate  Pickwick. Browne had been the illustrator of his little pamphlet Sunday under Three Heads. In the original edition of Pickwick, issued in shilling monthly parts from early in 1836 until the end of 1837, the first seven plates were drawn by Robert Seymour,  who committed suicide in April 1836. The next two plates were by Robert William Buss.\n\nBrowne and William Makepeace Thackeray visited the publishers' office with specimens of their work for Dickens's inspection. The novelist preferred Browne. Browne's first two etched plates for Pickwick were signed \"Nemo,\" but the third was signed \"Phiz,\" a pseudonym which was retained in future. When asked to explain why he chose this name he answered that the change from \"Nemo\" to \"Phiz\" was made to harmonize better with Dickens's \"Boz.\"\n\nPhiz developed the character Sam Weller graphically just as Seymour had developed Pickwick. Dickens and Phiz became good friends and in 1838 travelled together to Yorkshire to see the schools of which Nicholas Nickleby became the hero: afterwards they made several journeys of this nature in company to facilitate the illustrator's work. Other Dickens characters illustrated by Phiz were Squeers, Micawber, Guppy, Major Bagstock, Mrs Gamp, Tom Pinch and David Copperfield.\n\nOf the ten books by Dickens which Phiz illustrated, he is most known for David Copperfield, Pickwick, Dombey and Son, Martin Chuzzlewit and Bleak House. Browne made several drawings for Punch in his early days and also towards the end of his life. He designed the wrapper which was used for eighteen months from January 1842. He also contributed to Punch's Pocket Books.\n\nIn addition to his work for Dickens, Phiz illustrated more than twenty of Lever's novels (among them Harry Lorrequer, Charles O'Malley, Jack Hinton and the Knight of Gwynne). He also illustrated Harrison Ainsworth's and Frank Smedley's novels. Mervyn Clitheroe by Ainsworth is one of the most accomplished of the artist's works. Browne was in continual employment by publishers until 1867, when he suffered an illness that caused a degree of paralysis. After recovering, he produced many woodcuts. In 1878 he was awarded an annuity by the Royal Academy. His health gradually worsened until he died on 8 July 1882.\n\nMost of Browne's work was etched on steel plates because these yielded a far larger edition than copper. Browne was annoyed at some of his etchings being transferred to stone by the publishers and printed as lithographic reproductions. Partly with the view to prevent this treatment of his work, he employed a machine to rule a series of lines over the plate in order to obtain what appeared to be a tint; when manipulated with acid this tint gave an effect somewhat resembling mezzotint, which at that time it was found practically impossible to transfer to stone.\n\nFour of his illustrations were issued as stamps by the Royal Mail in 2012 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens. \n\nGallery\n\nFile:Phiz-Sarony- 1870s.jpg|Browne photographed by Sarony c.1870s\nImage:Hablot Knight Browne blue plaque.jpg|Blue plaque, Ladbroke Grove, London\nFile:Phiz Auriol.jpg|Scene from Auriol by Harrison Ainsworth, 1844\nFile:Pelham.jpg|Frontispiece to Pelham by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1849\nQuestion:\nWhat was the pen name of the illustrator Hablot Knight-Brown?\nAnswer:\nHablot Knight Browne\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nTop 10 Blondie Songs - Ultimate Classic Rock\nTop 10 Blondie Songs\nTop 10 Blondie Songs\nREDDIT\nMichael Ochs Archives, Getty Images\nBack in the late \u201970s, music was on a collision course of genres that would forever divide charts, playlists and fans. But as this list of the Top 10 Blondie Songs prove, the band seemed oblivious to it all. Or, more accurately, they were well aware that they were crossing lines \u2014 they just didn\u2019t care. Blondie came out of New York City\u2019s punk scene, but they were more tuneful (and pop-minded) and less artsy than most of their contemporaries. From the early-\u201960s girl-group pop they embraced early on through the disco beats that made them stars to the groundbreaking New Wave/hip-hop fusion of \u201cRapture,\u201d they rarely stayed in one place. So you\u2019ll find a sample platter of sounds on our list of the Top 10 Blondie Songs.\n10\nQuestion:\nWhat was Blondie's last UK No 1 of the 80s?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
