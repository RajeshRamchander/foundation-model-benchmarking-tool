Only then did I realize these furry pets haven\u2019t always been spinning on wheels in children\u2019s bedrooms.\nIn fact, there are 26 species of wild hamster that run free in parts of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, including\u00a0Mesocricetus auratus,\u00a0the Syrian hamster, which comes from the region surrounding Aleppo, Syria \u2014the city\u00a0currently under siege amid the Middle Eastern country\u2019s ongoing war. (Related pictures: \u201cSyrian Cultural Sites Damaged by Conflict .\u201d)\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the burrowing mammal as vulnerable : It has a small range, possibly less than about 1,900 square miles (5,000 square kilometers).\nThe first mention of the Syrian hamster was in 1797, when physician Alexander Russell came across them in the wild and described the rodents (though didn\u2019t give them a name) in a publication called\u00a0The Natural History of Aleppo.\nIt would be another 40 years or so until George Robert Waterhouse, curator of the London Zoological Society, formally named the species the golden hamster, according to Peter Logsdail, a hamster expert and author of Hamster Lopaedia.\nWaterhouse described an animal with soft fur and a silk-like gloss, with white feet and a tail and body colors of yellow and lead gray. Its \u201cmoustache\u201d\u2014what we\u2019d call whiskers today\u2014was black and white.\nThat pretty much covers what a modern golden hamster looks like, Logsdail told me, although nowadays there are all kinds of hues, from the chocolate tortoiseshell to the banded cinnamon. That\u2019s why its preferred name these days is Syrian hamster, since a lot of them aren\u2019t golden anymore.\nOut of the Wild\nSo how did the Syrian hamster get to Western Europe and America? We can thank Israel Aharoni, a zoologist who led a 1930 expedition to look for golden hamsters in Aleppo. He enlisted local Sheikh El-Beled to dig up a wheat field, where they found\u2014at a depth of 8 feet (2.4 meters)\u2014a golden hamster and her 11 young.\nAharoni put the family in a box, thinking that the mom would look after them. Instead, \u201cmum did what happens when she\u2019s disturbed\u2014she attacked one of the babies and chewed its head off,\u201d Logsdail said.\nSo the mother was euthanized, leaving Aharoni to raise ten babies by hand. Not surprising to most kids, the babies gnawed their way out of the wooden box, and Aharoni got nine of them back.\nOnce they were ensconced at Jerusalem\u2019s Hebrew University, another five made a jailbreak\u2014leaving Aharoni with just four hamsters, which bred very successfully (the Syrian hamster has the shortest gestation period of any hamster, just 16 days). (Also see \u201c 5 Jerboa Facts: Explaining Cute Jumping Rodent .\u201d)\nThe offspring were then sent to different universities and institutions, including the London Zoo, in the mid-1930s and into the mid-1940s they had become pets in the U.K. and the U.S.\u00a0In 1971, another litter of 12 were found in Aleppo and sent to the U.S. The rest, as they say, is hamster history.\nConsidering Syrian hamsters are already rare in the wild, scientists don\u2019t know if any remain.

The song became the group's international breakthrough single, receiving recognition around the world. It was their first Top 10 hit on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 10. The song also  peaked at number 11 in Australia, and achieved success in Japan and America. \n\nThe song was written by frontman Fran Healy who wrote the song while on holiday in Israel. He wanted to go somewhere sunny because in his hometown of Glasgow it rained all the time. In an interview at the Live 8 concert, he explained that he was spending a short holiday in the southern vacation city of Eilat, Israel in the middle of the winter.  The city is known for its hot weather even during winter time, but surprisingly it began to rain for two days during his stay. \n\nWhen Travis began to perform this song at the 1999 Glastonbury Festival, after being sunny for several hours, it began to rain exactly when the first line was sung.\n\nIn a poll by listeners of Absolute Radio the song was ranked 39th on a list of the top 100 songs of the 1990s.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe music video was directed by John Hardwick and filmed in Cornwall, with scenes filmed on Craddock Moor. The pool of water that the band jump into is part of a disused mining quarry known locally as \"Gold Digger's Mine\". The video features the band in a rain-soaked setting, with the band having locked frontman Healy, wearing a kilt, in the boot of a 1970s Vauxhall Viva. Healy escapes, and chases the rest of the band into a disused mining quarry. The video continues with the band being shown in a floating living room, performing the song. The video ends with the living room floating away.

Lazarets can be ships permanently at anchor, isolated islands, or mainland buildings.  In some lazarets, postal items were also disinfected, usually by fumigation.  This practice was still being done as late as 1936, albeit in rare cases. A leper colony administered by a Christian religious order was often called a lazar house, after the parable of Lazarus the beggar.\n\nLazarettos throughout history \n\nIn 1592, a lazaretto made of wooden huts was built on Manoel Island in Malta after an outbreak of the plague. It was pulled down in 1593, since the disease had subsided. In 1643, Grandmaster Lascaris built a permanent Lazzaretto in the same place to control the periodic influx of plague and cholera on board visiting ships. The hospital was subsequently improved over time, and was enlarged during the governorship of Sir Henry Bouverie in 1837 and 1838. The hospital was closed in 1929 and building still exists to this day.  There are plans for the restoration of the Manoel Island Lazaretto. \n\nAfricans imported to Savannah, Georgia during the days of the slavery typically had to wait at a quarantine station on Tybee Island, which the slave ships accessed by way of Lazaretto Creek. \n\nLazaretto Island (formerly known as Aghios Dimitrios) is located two nautical miles  north-east of Corfu (). In the early 16th century, when Corfu was under Venetian rule, a monastery was established on the islet for prevention of diseases. Later that century, the island was renamed Lazaretto, after the leprosarium that was set up there. In 1798, when the French ruled Corfu, the Russo-Turkish fleet took over the islet and ran it as a military hospital. In 1814, during the British occupation, the leprosarium was renovated and went into operation again. After the Ionian Islands were united with Greece (1864), the leprosarium only operated when needed.\n\nLazaretto Islet survives on Ithaca and another on Zakynthos.\n\nAccording to Edward Hasted in 1798, two large hospital ships (also called lazarettos), (which were the surviving hulks of forty-four gun ships) were moored in Halstow Creek in Kent. The creek is an inlet from the River Medway and the River Thames. The hospital ships watched over ships coming to England which were forced to stay in the creek under quarantine to protect the country from infectious diseases, including the plague.\n\nFidra, an uninhabited island in the Firth of Forth in eastern Scotland, has the ruins of an old chapel, dedicated to St. Nicholas, which was used as a lazaretto.[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid\n43439&strquery=fidrey#s30 British History Online]\n\nDuring the Nazi occupation of Poland, the German-run Treblinka extermination camp had a pit where new arrivals who were severely ill would be shot; the staff's euphemistic name for this area was the lazaret.\n\nAs of 2002, one of the few remaining lazarets in Europe is the one in Dubrovnik.\n\nIn the United States, the Philadelphia Lazaretto was built in 1799 as a response to the 1793 yellow fever outbreak. \n\nLazzarettos in Italy\n\nThe first lazaret was established by Venice in 1423  on Santa Maria di Nazareth (also called \"Nazaretum\" or \"Lazaretum\", today \"Lazzaretto Vecchio\"), an island in the Venetian Lagoon.   Additionally there is Lazzaretto Nuovo, also in the lagoon.\n\nPope Clement XII commissioned the architect Vanvitelli to design and build the Lazzaretto of Ancona at the south end of the Ancona harbor.\nQuestion:\nA lazaretto which can be an isolated island or a ship at anchor near a harbor is used for what purpose for maritime travelers?\nAnswer:\nQuarantine station\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nTop 10 Blondie Songs - Ultimate Classic Rock\nTop 10 Blondie Songs\nTop 10 Blondie Songs\nREDDIT\nMichael Ochs Archives, Getty Images\nBack in the late \u201970s, music was on a collision course of genres that would forever divide charts, playlists and fans.
