John Keble.\u00a0Dedicated to her \u2018little godsons\u2019 the book was written to illustrate and explain the Church Catechism.\u00a0The hymnal also contained other well known hymns, among them, All things bright and beautiful and Once in Royal David\u2019s City, written to celebrate the credal statements, Creator of heaven and earth and born of the Virgin Mary.\nTwo years after the publication she married the Revd. William Alexander.\u00a0He was six years her junior and the marriage caused\u00a0quite a stir\u00a0within her\u00a0own\u00a0family.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0is said that her father arranged, for the sake of propriety, for her birth date to be altered in the registers. [In some old hymn books her year of birth is given as 1823].\u00a0The two enjoyed a blissfully happy marriage and her husband later became Bishop of Derry and Archbishop of Armagh.\nHer poetical works were much admired and came to the attention of Alfred Lord Tennyson.\u00a0The composer Charles Gounod once remarked that There is a green hill was \u2018the most perfect hymn in the English language because of its charming simplicity.... the lyrics seemed to set themselves to music.\u2019\u00a0She is rightly regarded as one of the greatest of British women hymn writers.\nThere is a green hill was written to illustrate the words of the creed, \u2018Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried.\u2019\u00a0Mrs Alexander begins the first verse by painting a picture.\u00a0As a skilled teacher she knew that her first task was to capture a child\u2019s imagination.\u00a0In the second line she originally wrote \u2018without\u2019 a city wall, but changed it to \u2018outside\u2019 to remove any ambiguity.\nThe second verse celebrates the mystery of the cross, \u2018We may not know, we cannot tell....\u2019\u00a0The passion of Jesus, though difficult to comprehend, is something he endured for us and for our salvation.\u00a0This is celebrated in the next two verses, \u2018He died that we might be forgiven, he died to make us good...\u00a0There was no other good enough to pay the price of sin.\u2019\u00a0The noted New Testament scholar, Professor A. H. Hunter, once wrote, \u2018It was given to an Irish woman, in a hymn she wrote for little children, to express better than many a learned tome the purpose, the necessity and the challenge of that sacrifice which has in principle redeemed our prodigal race.\u2019\u00a0The hymn ends with a call for us to \u2018love as he has loved us.\u2019\nThough written for children this is a classic hymn for young and old.\u00a0It sets the scene of our Lord\u2019s passion and celebrates the mystery, the purpose, the necessity and the challenge of the cross.\u00a0It is usually sung to the tune Horsley, written by Willam Horsley [1774-1858].\nMrs. Alexander devoted her life to Christian education, to the care of the young and the poor.\u00a0All the profits from the sale of her writings were donated to a home for deaf children.\u00a0She was widely respected as a writer and many of her poems were published posthumously by her husband who survived her by sixteen years.\u00a0She was buried in her beloved Derry, outside the city walls.\nQuestion:\n\"\"\"We may not know, we cannot tell, what pains he had to bear\"\" are words from the second verse of which Easter hymn?\"\nAnswer:\n'THERE IS A GREEN HILL FAR AWAY'\nPassage:\nBen More (Mull)\nBen More (, meaning \"great mountain\") is the highest mountain and only Munro (mountains in Scotland that reach an elevation of 3000\u00a0feet or more) on the Isle of Mull, Scotland.\n\nIt is the highest peak in the Inner Hebrides apart from those on the Isle of Skye. The mountain is situated in the south of the island, above the shores of .\n\nAccess and climbing route\n\nThe peak is easiest reached from Loch na Keal, the walk up from the B8035 road following farm tracks, the side of a  stream; , and ultimately up scree slopes to the top. From the summit on a clear day, the view encompasses the Sound of Mull, Staffa, Ulva, the Ross of Mull and Iona in the distance. From sea loch to summit is approximately a four-hour walk.\n\nThe more demanding but rewarding route follows a boggy path up the banks of  to the  between  (\"The Breast\") and  (not to be confused with its namesake in Kintail).  From the  the route follows South West along a steep and rocky ridge first to the peak of  then on and up to Ben More itself.  There is respite at the top in a circular refuge of stones.  This route starts and ends on the B8035 road and is approximately a 6-hour walk and scramble.\n\nClimbers should be cautious when using a compass in misty conditions since there is magnetic rock in places, especially near the summit of the mountain.\n\nGeology\n\nAround 60 million years ago, the region was volcanically active, with Ben More being the remnant of a volcano, and it was in this period that the famous rock formations of Staffa and the basaltic columns of \"The Castles\" on Ulva came into being. The lava flows are known as the \"Staffa Magma Type member\" and can also be seen on Mull at , , and near Tobermory on its east coast. They are particularly rich in silica.\nQuestion:\nThe Scottish peak Ben More is the highest point on which island?\nAnswer:\nIsle of mull scotland\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nHennessy Gold Cup\n|}\n\nThe Hennessy Gold Cup is a Grade 3 National Hunt chase in Great Britain which is open to horses aged four years or older. It is run at Newbury over a distance of about 3 miles and 2\u00bd furlongs (5,331 metres), and during its running there are twenty-one fences to be jumped. It is a handicap race, and it is scheduled to take place each year in late November or early December.\n\nHistory\n\nThe event was established in 1957, and it was initially staged at Cheltenham. The winner of the inaugural running, Mandarin, was owned by Peggy Hennessy, a member of the family which founded Hennessy, the race's sponsoring company. It was transferred to Newbury in 1960, and it was won by Mandarin for a second time in 1961. The race's second running was won by Taxidermist, ridden by the amateur rider John Lawrence, later Lord Oaksey, who was the breeder and part-owner of the 2011 winner, Carruthers. \n\nThe race's association with Hennessy has continued throughout its history, and this now represents British racing's longest commercial sponsorship. The record was previously held by the Whitbread Gold Cup, which was first run seven months before the \"Hennessy\", and which was sponsored by Whitbread until 2001.\n\nThe Hennessy Gold Cup has been won by eight horses which have also achieved victory in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. The most recent of these is Bobs Worth, the winner of the latter race in 2013.\n\nMany Clouds became the first horse to win both the Hennessy Gold Cup and the Grand National, in 2014 and 2015 respectively.\n\nRecords\n\nMost successful horse (2 wins):\n* Mandarin \u2013 1957, 1961\n* Arkle \u2013 1964, 1965\n* Denman \u2013 2007, 2009\n\nLeading jockey (3 wins):\n* Willie Robinson \u2013 Mandarin (1961), Mill House (1963), Man of the West (1968)\n\nLeading trainer (7 wins):\n* Fulke Walwyn \u2013 Mandarin (1957, 1961), Taxidermist (1958), Mill House (1963), Man of the West (1968), Charlie Potheen (1972), Diamond Edge (1981)\n\nWinners\n\n* Weights given in stones and pounds; Amateur jockeys indicated by \"Mr\".\n\n Be My Royal finished first in 2002, but he was subsequently disqualified after testing positive for a banned substance.\nQuestion:\nAt which English racecourse would you see the 'Hennessy Gold Cup'?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
