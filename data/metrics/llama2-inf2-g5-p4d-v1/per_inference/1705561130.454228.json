It was adapted into a television mini-series starring John Thaw and Lindsay Duncan. Reviewers praised the book's honest style, wit[http://french.about.com/library/reviews/aafpr-yearinprovence.htm A Year in Provence, by Peter Mayle] and its refreshing humour.  The book was turned into an equally popular radio version.\n\nPlot\n\nPeter Mayle and his wife move to Provence, and are soon met with unexpectedly fierce weather, underground truffle dealers and unruly workers, who work around their normalement schedule.  Meals in Proven\u00e7al restaurants and work on the Mayles' house, garden and vineyard are features of the book, whose chapters follow the months of the year.\n\nMini-series\n\nIn 1993, the BBC produced a television mini-series based on the book, starring Lindsay Duncan and John Thaw, with appearances from Alfred Molina and James Fleet amongst others. Unlike the book, the miniseries was\nnot well received by critics; A Year in Provence was later placed at number ten on a Radio Times list of \nthe worst television programs ever made   \n  with the writer, John Naughton, describing\nit as the \"\"smugathon\" series A Year In Provence \" and stated it \"achieved the near impossible - creating a John Thaw vehicle nobody liked\".\nQuestion:\nIn the television programme 'A Year In Provence', which actress played the part of Peter Mayle's wife?\nAnswer:\nLindsay Vere Duncan\nPassage:\nEast Lyn River\nThe East Lyn is a river which rises high in Exmoor, in the English county of Somerset. It flows through the East Lyn Valley in Devon.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Lynmouth Disaster occurred on the East Lyn river  due to rocks and fallen trees having been washed into the West Lyn river. These formed a log jam near Watersmeet, forming a landslide dam. When the pressure behind the dam increased to uncontrollable levels, the water broke out of the dam, and rushed down the East Lyn (via the convergence of the rivers) into Lynmouth, obliterating houses and ultimately resulting in 34 deaths. Boulders from the incident can still be seen today, lining the banks of the East Lyn as it travels into Lynmouth today.\n\nWatercourse\n\nThe river is formed as the Upper East Lyn at Malmsmead from two minor tributaries, the Oare Water and Badgworthy Water. It flows for several miles, past Brendon and makes confluence with Hoar Oak Water at Watersmeet, where Watersmeet House is situated.  The river then passes through a narrow gorge section, before flowing downstream for a further  until the river meets with the West Lyn River and flows into the Bristol Channel at Lynmouth. \n\nRecreation\n\nAngling\n\nAngling interests especially in the summer are targeted towards the salmon which migrate up the river to spawn. There is also trout fishing. \n\nWalking\n\nIt is popular for walkers with the Two Moors Way near to much of the river.\n\nWhitewater kayaking\n\nWhitewater kayakers frequently run this river in the winter when seeking a challenging Grade 4 paddle.\nQuestion:\nThe River Lyn is in which English county?\nAnswer:\nDevon, England\nPassage:\nJay Records - Therese Raquin\nJay Records - Therese Raquin\nJAY RECORDS\nBuy now from Jay Records\n$29.99\nA startling new musical adaptation of the classic French novel\u00a0\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin...by \u00c8mile Zola\nMusic by Craig Adams\nBook & Lyrics by Nona Shepphard\n1860s Paris.\u00a0In a small dusty haberdasher\u2019s shop near the Seine in the dank, narrow Passage du Pont Neuf, the young and beautiful Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin is trapped in a loveless marriage to her sickly cousin, Camille. While her husband is out all day working, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se spends her days confined behind the counter of a small shop and - every Thursday evening - watching her domineering aunt, Madame Raquin, play dominoes with an eclectic group of ne'er-do-wells.

Barfield created the London Eye together with husband partner David Marks.

She was influenced by Buckminster Fuller and his beliefs on how architects have a social and environmental responsibility. \n\nEducation \n\nJulia Barfield studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture from 1972 to 1978. During her year out, she went to South America and worked in the barriadas of Lima in Peru designing housing and a community centre.\n\nExperience \n\nAfter graduation, Barfield worked for Foster and Partners for nine years. In 1990, together with husband David Marks, they founded Marks Barfield Architects. During the last 13 years, with Marks, she has designed projects in the leisure, housing, transport, education and cultural sectors. \n\nLondon Eye\n\nThe best thing about the Eye is the journey. It\u2019s not like the Eiffel tower, where you get in a dark lift and come out on to a platform at the top. The trip round is as important as the view. -Julia Barfield, 2015\n\nIn 1993, the Sunday Times and the Architecture Foundation held an open competition to design a landmark for the millennium, which would in turn be the London Eye. \n\nAwards \n\nBarfield is the winner of \"Architectural Practice of the Year\" in 2001 and a \"Queen's Award for Enterprise\" in 2003.\nQuestion:\nb Which London landmark was designed by David Marks and Julia Barfield?\nAnswer:\nBA London Eye\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nMuhammad Ali refuses to fight in Vietnam war: From the ...\nMuhammad Ali refuses to fight in Vietnam war: From the archive, 27 April 1967 | From the Guardian | The Guardian\nShare on Messenger\nClose\nBoxing authorities in America today stripped Muhammad Ali (Cassius Clay) of his world heavyweight title and suspended his boxing licence after he had refused to be inducted into the United States Army.\nClay had stood in line with 11 other men being called up in a room in the old Post Office building in Houston, Texas, and heard his Black Muslim name called by the officer administering the oath. Clay did not move. Another officer walked up to him and said: \"Mr Ali, will you accompany me, please ?\" Clay did not speak, but followed him out of the room to be given a warning of the consequences of his refusal.\nHe was taken back into the room and given a second chance to take the oath, but he again refused. He then signed a statement to that effect.\nSoon after he left the centre, to be mobbed by well-wishers, the New York Boxing Commission, the World Boxing Association, and the Texas Boxing Commission withdrew their recognition of him as champion.\nReading on mobile?

If an indictment were returned, Clay would have to go for trial. He could face a long prison sentence.\nClay issued a statement saying: \"It is in the light of my consciousness as a Muslim minister and my own personal convictions that I take my stand in rejecting the call to be inducted. I do so with the full realisation of its implications. I have searched my conscience.\n\"I had the world heavyweight title not because it was given to me, not because of my race or religion, but because I won it in the ring. Those who want to take it and start a series of auction-type bouts not only do me a disservice, but actually disgrace themselves... Sports fans and fair-minded people throughout America would never accept such a title-holder.\"\nThe New York Boxing Commission, which suspended his licence, said his refusal to enter the service was detrimental to the best interests of boxing.\n[Muhammad Ali was sentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine, though he remained out on bail while he appealed. He was stripped of his passport and his heavyweight title and banned from fighting in the US.
