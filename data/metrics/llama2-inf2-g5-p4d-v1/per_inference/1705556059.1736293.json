A country bumpkin, he is arrested in the first scene for flouting the king's proclamation that all men of the court avoid the company of women for three years.  While in custody, the men of the court use him to further their own romantic endeavors.  By sending love notes to the wrong women and blurting out secrets (including that of an unplanned pregnancy), Costard makes fools of the royal court.  Along with Moth the page and Jaquenetta, a country wench, Costard pokes fun at the upper-class.  While mocking a pedantic schoolmaster, Costard uses the word honorificabilitudinitatibus, the longest word by far from any of Shakespeare's works.\n\nCostard makes many clever puns, and is used as a tool by Shakespeare to explain new words such as remuneration. He is sometimes considered one of the smartest characters in the play due to his wit and wordplay.\n\nCostard's name is an archaic term for apple, or metaphorically a man's head.  Shakespeare uses the word in this sense in Richard III.\nQuestion:\nA costard is what type of fruit?\nAnswer:\nApple Blossom\nPassage:\nAmychophobia | Article about amychophobia by The Free ...\nAmychophobia | Article about amychophobia by The Free Dictionary\nAmychophobia | Article about amychophobia by The Free Dictionary\nhttp://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/amychophobia\n[\u201aam\u00b7\u0259\u00b7k\u0259\u2032f\u014db\u00b7\u0113\u00b7\u0259]\n(psychology)\nAbnormal fear of being scratched or clawed.\nWant to thank TFD for its existence?

From his birth in 63 B.C. he was Octavius; after his adoption was announced in 44 B.C., Octavian; and beginning in 26 B.C. the Roman Senate conferred on him the name Augustus, the august or exalted one. He was born Gaius Octavius Thurinus in Velletri, 20 miles from Rome. His father was a senator and governor in the Roman Republic. His mother Atai was Caesar\u2019s niece, and the young Octavius was raised in part by his grandmother Julia Ceasaris, Caesar\u2019s sister.\nDid You Know?\nIn 8 B.C. Augustus had the Roman month of Sextilius renamed after himself\u2014as his great-uncle and predecessor Julius Caesar had done with July. August was the month of several of the emperor's greatest victories, including the defeat and suicide of Antony and Cleopatra. He did not increase the month's length, which had been 31 days since the establishment of the Julian calendar in 45 B.C.\nOctavius donned the toga, the Roman sign of manhood, at age 16, and began taking on responsibilities through his family connections. In 47 B.C. he went to Hispania (modern-day Spain) to fight alongside Caesar. He was shipwrecked along the way, and had to cross enemy territory to reach his great-uncle\u2014an act that impressed Caesar enough to name Octavius his heir and successor in his will.\nAugustus: The Path to Power\nThe 17-year-old Octavius was at Apollonia (in present-day Albania) when the news of Caesar\u2019s death and his own inheritance arrived. The dead ruler\u2019s allies, including many in the senate, rallied around Octavian against their powerful rival Mark Antony . But after Octavian\u2019s troops defeated Antony\u2019s army in northern Italy, the future emperor refused an all-out pursuit of Antony, preferring an uneasy alliance with his rival.\nIn 43 B.C. Octavian, Antony and Marcus Aemilus Lepidus established the Second Triumvirate, a power-sharing agreement that divided up Rome\u2019s territories among them, with Antony given the East, Lepidus Africa and Octavian the West. In 41 B.C. Antony began a romantic and political alliance with Cleopatra , queen of Egypt, which continued even after a Senatorial decree forced his marriage to Octavian\u2019s sister Octavia Minor. Lepidus remained a minor figure until Octavian finally had him ousted after the triumvirate\u2019s renewal in 37 B.C.\nAntony\u2019s affair with Cleopatra continued, and in 32 B.C. he divorced Octavia. In retaliation, Octavian declared war on Cleopatra. In the naval battle of Actium a year later, Octavian\u2019s fleet, under his admiral Agrippa, cornered and defeated Antony\u2019s ships. Cleopatra\u2019s navy raced to aid her ally, but in the end the two lovers barely escaped. They returned to Egypt and committed suicide, leaving Octavian as Rome\u2019s undisputed ruler.\nAugustus: Emperor in All but Name\nHistorians date the start of Octavian\u2019s monarchy to either 31 B.C. (the victory at Actium) or 27 B.C., when he was granted the name Augustus. In that four-year span, Octavian secured his rule on multiple fronts. Cleopatra\u2019s seized treasure allowed him to pay his soldiers, securing their loyalty. To mollify Rome\u2019s Senate and ruling classes, he passed laws harkening back\u2014at least on the surface\u2014to the traditions of the Roman Republic. And to win over the people, he worked to improve and beautify the city of Rome.\nDuring his 40-years reign, Augustus nearly doubled the size of the empire, adding territories in Europe and Asia Minor and securing alliances that gave him effective rule from Britain to India. He spent much of his time outside of Rome, consolidating power in the provinces and instituting a system of censuses and taxation that integrated the empire\u2019s furthest reaches. He expanded the Roman network of roads, founded the Praetorian Guard and the Roman postal service and remade Rome with both grand (a new forum) and practical gestures (police and fire departments).\nAugustus: Family and Succession\nAugustus married three times, although his first union, to Mark Antony\u2019s stepdaughter Clodia Pulchra, was unconsummated. His second wife, Scribonia, bore his only child, Julia the Elder. He divorced in 39 B.C. to marry Livia Drusilla, who had two sons\u2014Tiberius and Drusus\u2014by her first husband, Mark Antony\u2019s ally Tiberius Claudius Nero . The family tree became more complicated after Augustus had his stepson Tiberius briefly marry his daughter, and then adopted Tiberius outright as son and successor in A.D. 4.\nAugustus Caesar died in A.D. 14, his empire secured and at peace. His reported last words were twofold: to his subjects he said, \u201cI found Rome of clay; I leave it to you of marble,\u201d but to the friends who had stayed with him in his rise to power he added, \u201cHave I played the part well? Then applaud me as I exit.\u201d Soon after that acknowledgement of human frailty, the Roman Senate officially declared their departed emperor, like Julius Caesar before him, to be a god.\nTags\nQuestion:\nWho was the first emperor of Rome?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
