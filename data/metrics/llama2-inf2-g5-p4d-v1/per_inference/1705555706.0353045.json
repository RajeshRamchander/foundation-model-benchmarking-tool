Hucknall achieved international fame in the 1980s as the lead singer and songwriter of the soul-influenced pop band Simply Red, with whom he enjoyed a 25-year career and sold over 50 million albums. Hucknall is recognisable for his smooth, distinctive voice and wide vocal range, as well as his red curly hair, and has been described as \"one of the truly great blue-eyed soul singers\". \n\nEarly life\n\nHucknall, born at St Mary's Hospital, Manchester,   was an only child. His mother abandoned the family when he was three; the upheaval caused by this event inspired him to write \"Holding Back the Years,\" which would become one of Simply Red's biggest and best-known hits. He was brought up by his father, Reginald (1935\u20132009),  a barber in Stockport.  He attended Audenshaw School.  It would not be until the mid-1990s that he would finally reconnect with his mother, Maureen, who was by then living in Dallas. As of a 2008 interview, he had only seen her on two occasions since she first abandoned the family. \n\nMusic career \n\nHucknall was among the people present at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester in June 1976 where the Sex Pistols were playing.  His interest in the music scene led to the launch of his career in the late 1970s, when he was part of the formation of the band Frantic Elevators.\n\nThe Frantic Elevators released four singles, including a version of \"Holding Back the Years\", which he later recorded with Simply Red.\n\nAs lead singer and core member of Simply Red, he became the identifiable face of the band. His face and long curly red hair were featured prominently on album artwork and in videos.\n\nHucknall is also one of the founders and financial backers of the successful reggae label Blood and Fire. He also manages the record label simplyred.com.\n\nIn October 2007, on David Jensen's show on the Gold network, he announced Simply Red would split in 2009. \n\nIn 2008 Hucknall released his first solo album Tribute to Bobby, a tribute to the blues musician Bobby \"Blue\" Bland. \n\nIn June 2009, Hucknall took part in Songbook as part of the Sky Arts series, whereby music artists reflect on their favourite compositions and their background history in music.\n\nIn October 2009, Mick appeared at a charity performance as vocalist for a re-formed version of Faces, replacing Rod Stewart. In May 2010, it was announced that the new Faces line-up with Mick as frontman would be performing festival shows in 2010, followed by a world tour in 2011. \n\nIn October 2012, he released American Soul, a collection of his favourite music re-recorded with his vocals. During a series of interviews promoting the American Soul album, Hucknall revealed that he has also been working on an album of original material, to be released after American Soul has reached the end of its life cycle.\n\nPolitics \n\nHucknall is active in politics and is a prominent celebrity supporter of the UK Labour Party. In 1997, he declared his support for the Labour Party at that year's general election \u2013 which it won by a landslide under the leadership of Tony Blair to return to government after 18 years in opposition.  In 1998 Hucknall was named in a list of those who donated more than \u00a35,000 to the party.  In 2003, Hucknall backed Tony Blair's stance on Operation Iraqi Freedom, claiming he had \"more respect for Blair than ever\" and pointed out that British critics of the war were lucky to be living in a country where they could express their opinions. However, he claimed in 2008 that his conscience prevented him from donating to the party again because of the war, although he would still vote for them. \n\nHucknall has commented that derogatory references to his red hair are a form of bigotry. \n\nHucknall was a guest on the panel for the BBC's political discussion series Question Time, broadcast on 27 March 2014, and declared his support for same-sex marriage. \n\nPersonal life\n\nHucknall and his partner, Gabriella Wesberry, had a daughter, Romy True Hucknall, in June 2007.  Hucknall and Wesberry married in 2010, at the 16th-century Forter Castle in Glenisla, Perthshire, Scotland.  He spends a considerable amount of time in Ireland, where he purchased the Glenmore Estate near the village of Cloghan, County Donegal, with bandmate Chris De Margary. Hucknall and De Margary are keen fishermen, and operate a fishing and hunting tourism business from the estate.  \n\nHe co-owns Ask Property Development, a company that constructs city squares and public buildings. \n\nHe spends much time in Catania, Sicily, where he produces wines under the label \"Il Cantante\" (The Singer). \n\nHucknall is a Manchester United fan. \n\nHe has dated a handful of celebrities throughout his career.  In 2010, Hucknall admitted that in his most successful years, between 1985 and 1987, he would have sex with about three women a day and described himself as a sex addict. \n\nSolo discography\n\nAlbums\n\nSingles\n\nOther appearances\n\nIn 1986, he provided backup vocals for the musical film Little Shop of Horrors.\nQuestion:\nWhat is Mick Hucknell's band?\nAnswer:\nSimply Red\nPassage:\nThe Absinthe Drinker - Pablo Picasso - WikiArt.org ...\nThe Absinthe Drinker, 1901 - Pablo Picasso - WikiArt.org\nThe Absinthe Drinker\nit is a historically significant artwork\nthe image is only being used for informational and educational purposes\nthe image is readily available on the internet\nthe image is a low resolution copy of the original artwork and is unsuitable for commercial use\nMore \u2026\nWikiArt.org allows unlimited copying, distributing and displaying of the images of public domain artworks solely.

Merrie Melodies cartoon, directed by Robert McKimson and written by Tedd Pierce starring Bennie the fat cat and George. It was animated in 1952. Voices by Mel Blanc and music by Carl Stalling. It was the first appearance of Speedy Gonzales, in a prototype form.  Because this cartoon's rendition of Speedy Gonzales looked rather coarse, they redesigned him for future cartoon releases.\n\nPlot\n\nThe two cats pursuing Speedy in Cat-Tails for Two are the slow-witted (and injury-causing) Benny and the fully functioning but unfortunate George, both patterned after the characters Lennie and George in the novel Of Mice and Men. George and Benny are walking down a pier looking for food, when they find a Mexican ship. Figuring the ship will have plenty of Mexican mice, i.e. \"Mexican food\" (Benny: \"It gives me the heartburn and I love it!\"), they climb on, only to find an unkempt mouse calling himself \"Speedy Gonzales: Fastest Mouse in All Mexico\".\n\nGeorge and Benny go through numerous attempts to capture Speedy, who always outwits them. Speedy comes to think of them as private entertainment, at one point declaring \"I like those fellows. All the time having fon (fun)!\" Among the cats' failed attempts:\n\n1. A crate full of \"Acme Anvils\" set above a piece of cheese. With Benny holding the rope and George setting the bait, Speedy gives Benny a scare from behind, causing him to let go of the rope and the crate to flatten George. As punishment, George swings down on Benny's cranium with a mallet, but the mallet bounces off Benny's head right on top of his own! When Benny asks \"Why did you hit yourself on the head for, George?\", the slap-happy cat answers: \"I like it, I like it!!\"\n\n2. George sets up seven pieces of cheese with dynamite-stick booby traps throughout the ship, but doesn't have a match to light the sticks. Speedy taunts George with a match and sets him up to take the explosions. Benny comes to the rescue by cooling George down, but misinterprets a bucket of petrol as \"a funny way to spell 'water'\" leaving him half furless.\n\n3. A pipe with one end disguised as an entranceway to a cabaret and Benny standing at the other end with a mallet. When Speedy enters the pipe, George fires a skyrocket in behind him, the idea being to force Speedy out into the path of the mallet. But the rocket unexpectedly yanks George through the pipe behind it. Speedy is too fast for Benny, and Benny ends up clobbering George when he is pulled out the other side turning his head into a mallet size.\n\nFinally, the two cats run a pipe into Speedy's hiding place (to the tune of Raymond Scott's Powerhouse), but Speedy grabs a wrench and bends the pipe back around to the cats, unbeknownst to them. George starts shoving a lot of dynamite into the pipe, resulting in a mountain of TNT piling up behind him and Benny. When George is done shoving dynamite through the pipe, he lights the last stick with a match, and the mountain of dynamite blasts him and Benny up into the air. As they descend, Benny asks George about their Mexican dinner, with George responding \"I kind of lost my appetite for Mexican food,\" before both cats plunge into the harbor. A smug Speedy looks at the camera and declares \"I love those fellows. They're so see-lee (silly)!\" Iris out.\nQuestion:\nWhich famous animated character, first seen in 1953 in a feature called 'Cat Tails for Two' was usually wearing an over-sized sombrero, white shirt and trousers and red kerchief?\nAnswer:\nAriba Ariba\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nThe Owl and the Pussy-Cat | Poetry In Voice\nThe Owl and the Pussy-Cat | Poetry In Voice\nThe Owl and the Pussy-Cat\nThe Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea\nIn a beautiful pea-green boat,\nThey took some honey, and plenty of money,\nWrapped up in a five-pound note.\nThe Owl looked up to the stars above,\nAnd sang to a small guitar,\n\u2018O lovely Pussy!
