In addition to The Archers, Seed has appeared in the TV soap operas Brookside (1995\u201397, as Dick Thornton), Coronation Street (1981, as a solicitor) and Crossroads (1985\u201388, as Charlie Mycroft).  \n\nSeed's roles include the adult Britannicus, son of the emperor Claudius in the BBC adaptation of Robert Graves, I, Claudius (1976), Harrop in William Boyd's Channel 4 Film Good and Bad at Games (1983) and Jorkins in the first episode \"Et in Arcadia ego\" of the  ITV television adaptation of Brideshead Revisited (1981). He also appeared in Edward VII (1975), Bergerac (1981), C.A.B. (1986) Midsomer Murders (2009)  and Wild Target (2010).\n\nAmong Seed's close friends is the novelist Mavis Cheek. \n\nPersonal life \n\nSeed married his long-time partner, the theatre producer and actress Denise Silvey,  on 9 January 2013.\nQuestion:\nGraham Seed played which character in 'The Archers' for almost thirty years?\nAnswer:\nNIGEL PARGETTER\nPassage:\nToucan\nToucans are members of the family Ramphastidae of near passerine birds from the Neotropics. The Ramphastidae family is most closely related to the American barbets. They are brightly marked and have large often-colorful bills. The family includes five genera and about forty different species. The name of this bird group is derived from the Tupi word  tukana, via Portuguese.  The family includes toucans, aracaris and toucanets; more distant relatives include various families of barbets and woodpeckers in the suborder Pici.\n\nMorphology\n\nToucans range in size from the lettered aracari (Pteroglossus inscriptus), at 130 g (4.6\u00a0oz) and 29\u00a0cm (11.5\u00a0inches), to the toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), at 680 g (1.5\u00a0lb) and 63\u00a0cm (29\u00a0inches). Their bodies are short (of comparable size to a crow's) and compact. The tail is rounded and varies in length, from half the length to the whole length of the body. The neck is short and thick. The wings are small, as they are forest-dwelling birds who only need to travel short distances, and are often of about the same span as the bill-tip-to-tail-tip measurements of the bird.\n\nThe legs of the toucan are strong and rather short. Their toes are arranged in pairs with the first and fourth toes turned backward. The majority of toucans do not show any sexual dimorphism in their coloration, the genus Selenidera being the most notable exception to this rule (hence their common name, \"dichromatic toucanets\"). However, the bills of female toucans are usually shorter, deeper and sometimes straighter, giving more of a \"blocky\" impression compared to male bills. The feathers in the genus containing the largest toucans are generally black, with touches of white, yellow, and scarlet. The underparts of the ara\u00e7aris (smaller toucans) are yellow, crossed by one or more black or red bands. The toucanets have mostly green plumage with blue markings.\n\nThe colorful and large bill, which in some large species measures more than half the length of the body, is the hallmark of toucans. Despite its size, the toucan's bill is very light, being composed of bone struts filled with spongy tissue of keratin  between them. The bill has forward-facing serrations resembling teeth, which historically led naturalists to believe that toucans captured fish and were primarily carnivorous; today it is known that they eat mostly fruit. Researchers have discovered that the large bill of the toucan is a highly efficient thermoregulation system, though its size may still be advantageous in other ways.   It does aid in their feeding behavior (as they sit in one spot and reach for all fruit in range, thereby reducing energy expenditure), and it has also been theorized that the bill may intimidate smaller birds, so that the toucan may plunder nests undisturbed (see Diet below). Also, the beak allows the bird to reach deep into tree-holes to access food unavailable to other birds, and also to ransack suspended nests built by smaller birds. However, as there is no sexual dimorphism in coloration it is unlikely to be a sexual signal.\n\nA toucan's tongue is long (up to 14\u201315\u00a0cm, or 6\u00a0inches), narrow, grey, and singularly frayed on each side, adding to its sensitivity as an organ of taste.\n\nA structural complex probably unique to toucans involves the modification of several tail vertebrae.  The rear three vertebrae are fused and attached to the spine by a ball and socket joint. Because of this, toucans may snap their tail forward until it touches the head.   This is the posture in which they sleep, often appearing simply as a ball of feathers, with the tip of the tail sticking out over the head.\n\nHabitat \n\nToucans are native to Southern Mexico, Central America, the northern part of South America, and the Caribbean region. They generally live in tropical and sub-tropical regions.\n\nToucans are arboreal and typically lay 2\u201321 white eggs in their nests. They make their nests in tree hollows and holes excavated by other animals such as woodpeckers\u2014the toucan bill has very limited use as an excavation tool. When the eggs hatch, the young emerge completely naked, without any down.  Toucans are resident breeders and do not migrate. Toucans are usually found in pairs or small flocks.  They sometimes fence with their bills and wrestle, which scientists hypothesize they do to establish dominance hierarchies.\n\nDiet \n\nToucans are primarily frugivorous (fruit eating), but are opportunistically omnivorous and will take prey such as insects and small lizards.   Captive toucans have been reported to hunt insects actively in their cages, and it is possible to keep toucans on an insect-only diet. They also plunder nests of smaller birds, taking eggs and nestlings.Nadkarni, Nalini M. ; Wheelwright, Nathaniel T. (Editors). Monteverde: Ecology and Conservation of a Tropical Cloud Forest. Publisher: Oxford University Press, 2000. ISBN 978-0-19-513310-3  This probably provides a crucial addition of protein to their diet. Certainly, apart from being systematically predatory as well as frugivorous, like many omnivorous birds, they particularly prefer animal food for feeding their chicks.Short, Lester; Horne, Jennifer. Toucans, Barbets and Honeyguides. Publisher: Oxford University Press 2002. ISBN 978-0-19-854666-5 However, in their range, toucans are the dominant frugivores, and as such, play an extremely important ecological role as vectors for seed dispersal of fruiting trees. \n\nSystematic list\n\n* Genus Aulacorhynchus\u2014green toucanets (6\u201315 species, depending on taxonomy)\n* Genus Selenidera\u2014dichromatic toucanets (6 species)\n* Genus Andigena\u2014mountain toucans (4 species) \n* Genus Pteroglossus\u2014ara\u00e7aris (14 species, incl. saffron toucanet)\n* Genus Ramphastos\u2014typical toucans (about 12 species)\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThe mascot of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party is a blue and yellow colored toucan; party members are called tucanos for this reason.\n\nThe Toucan Tecs was a 1992 UK Television cartoon, broadcast on CiTV, about two detective toucans named Zippi and Zac.\n\nThe constellation Tucana, containing most of the Small Magellanic Cloud, is named after the toucan.\n\nThe mascot of the Kellogg's brand cereal Froot Loops is Toucan Sam.\n\nTwo toucans appear in the animated film Rio.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s Guinness (beer) advertising often featured a toucan.\nQuestion:\nThe Tocantino River (the name means Toucan's Beak) runs for 2640 km from South to North in which country?\nAnswer:\nBrazil\nPassage:\nSteve Young Biography (Football Player) - Infoplease\nSteve Young Biography (Football Player)\nBirthplace: Salt Lake City, Utah\nBest known as: Quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers\nSteve Young played quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers for 13 years, 1987-99, taking the starting job from highly popular quarterback Joe Montana in 1991.   Young was named the NFL's most valuable player in 1992 and 1994, and in 1995 the 49ers won Super Bowl XXIX.   At the start of his career Young played two seasons (1984-85) with the Los Angeles Express of the now-defunct United States Football League, then spent two seasons with the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers before being traded to San Francisco.  Young was left-handed, a rarity among pro quarterbacks.  He retired after the 1999 season.\nExtra credit:\nYoung was inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame on 7 August 2005\u2026 Young is a great-great-great-grandson of Mormon leader Brigham Young .\nCopyright \u00a9 1998-2017   by Who2?, LLC.

The word is derived from the Greek \u1f40\u03c8\u03ad (ops\u00e9), meaning 'late' and \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 (manth\u00e1n\u014d), meaning 'learn'. \n\nOpsimathy was once frowned upon, used as a put-down with implications of laziness,  and considered less effective by educators than early learning.  The emergence of \"opsimath clubs\"  has demonstrated that opsimathy has shed much of this negative connotation,  and that this approach may, in fact, be desirable. \n\nNotable opsimaths include the fictitious character Sir Henry Rawlinson, Grandma Moses, mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s (who published papers until his death at age 83), and Cato the Elder, who learned Greek only at the age of 80.\nQuestion:\nAn opsimath is a person who begins to do what later in life?\nAnswer:\nStudy\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nTelephone - Wot-U-Know Wiseowl - Google Sites\nTelephone - Wot-U-Know Wiseowl\nWot-U-Know Wiseowl\nWhen Alexander Graham Bell got the patent for the telephone and other facts\nAdditional Facts\nThe telephone was a culmination of work done by many individuals, sharing and borrowing each other's ideas\nEdinburgh-born Alexander Graham Bell patented his telephone model just hours before a rival inventor\nTelephone came about\u00a0through the discovery that a thin metal sheet vibrating in an electromagnetic field produces an electrical waveform that corresponds to the vibration and can be acoustically reproduced\nBell may have made the first call to his assistant in the next room 'Mr Watson, come here - I want to see you'\nThey first publicly demonstrated their invention at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876\nA month later, they made their first long-distance call - over 10 miles - between their respective homes in Canada\nIn 1877, Bell set up the Bell Telephone Company, and 150,000 households in the US had telephones within a decade\nBell's industrious mind was also responsible for the loudspeaker (1876) and the forerunner of the metal detector (1881)\nQuestion:\nWhat was first demonstrated by Alexander Graham Bell at the Philadelphia Exhibition in 1876?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
