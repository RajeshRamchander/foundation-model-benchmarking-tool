It is constructed in accordance with a detailed set of specifications published by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Its overall length must be at least 260 cm (102.4 inches) and its weight at least 800 grams (1.8 pounds). The women\u2019s javelin is somewhat shorter and lighter\u2014a minimum 220 cm (86.6 inches) long and 600 grams (1.3 pounds) in weight.\nJavelin throw, side view.\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.\nAfter a short run, the javelin is thrown directly forward with an over-the-shoulder motion into a 29\u00b0 sector marked on the field. It must land point first. The thrower\u2019s body may not rotate a full turn (360\u00b0) before the javelin is released, and he may not step on or beyond a line at the end of the runway.\nScandinavian athletes dominated the first 50 years of men\u2019s javelin competition. Sweden conducted the first national championship in the event in 1896, and Swedish and Finnish athletes held most world records until 1953. The javelin throw has been an Olympic event since 1908; a women\u2019s javelin event was added to the Olympic program in 1932.\nLearn More in these related articles:\nQuestion:\nWhat Olympic event involves throwing a spear?\nAnswer:\nAkontion\nPassage:\nA Harlot's Progress\nA Harlot's Progress (also known as The Harlot's Progress) is a series of six paintings (1731, now destroyed) and engravings (1732) by the English artist William Hogarth. The series shows the story of a young woman, M. (Moll or Mary) Hackabout, who arrives in London from the country and becomes a prostitute. The series was developed from the third image: having painted a prostitute in her boudoir in a garret on Drury Lane, Hogarth struck upon the idea of creating scenes from her earlier and later life. The title and rich allegory are reminiscent of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress.\n\nIn the first scene, an old woman praises her beauty and suggests a profitable occupation, procuring her for the gentleman shown towards the back of the image. She is a mistress with two lovers in the second, has become a common prostitute on the point of being arrested in the third, and is beating hemp in Bridewell Prison in the fourth. By the fifth, she is dying from venereal disease, and she is dead aged only 23 in the last.\n\nHistory\n\nThe protagonist \"M. Hackabout\" (see Plate 1, Plate 3, and the coffin-lid in Plate 6, which reads: \"M. Hackabout Died Sepr 2d 1731 Aged 23\") is either named after the heroine of Moll Flanders and Kate Hackabout or ironically after the Blessed Virgin Mary.  Kate was a notorious prostitute and the sister of highwayman Francis Hackabout: he was hanged on 17 April 1730; she was convicted of keeping a disorderly house in August the same year, having been arrested by Westminster magistrate Sir John Gonson.\n\nThe series of paintings proved to be very popular and Hogarth used his experience as an apprentice to a silversmith to create engravings of the images, selling a \"limited edition\" of 1,240 sets of six prints to subscribers for a Guinea. Pirate copies of the engravings were soon in circulation, and Hogarth procured a 1735 Act of Parliament (8 Geo. II. cap. 13) to prohibit the practice. Soon after, Hogarth published his second series of satirical and moralistic images, A Rake's Progress, followed some years later by Marriage \u00e0-la-mode.\n\nThe original paintings were destroyed in a fire at Fonthill House in 1755, the country house of William Beckford (1709\u20131770), a politician and father of William Thomas Beckford (1 October 1760 \u2013 2 May 1844) builder of Fonthill Abbey in Wiltshire. The original plates survived, and were sold by Hogarth's widow, Jane, to John Boydell in 1789; by him to Baldwin, Cradock and Joy in 1818; and then to Henry Bohn in 1835. Each produced further copies.\n\nAdaptation\n\nBritish composer Iain Bell composed an operatic adaptation of the work which opened at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna in 2013 with German soprano Diana Damrau in the title role. The world premiere of the opera A Harlot's Progress was on 13 October 2013. \n\nThe plates\nQuestion:\n\u2018The Harlot\u2019s Progress\u2019 is a series of paintings and engravings by which 18th Century English painter?\nAnswer:\nHogarthian\nPassage:\nCentral London\nCentral London is the innermost part of London, England. There is no official definition of its area, but its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. Over time a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics, urban planning and local government. \n\nRoad distances to London are traditionally measured from a central point at Charing Cross (in the City of Westminster), which is marked by the statue of King Charles I at the junction of the Strand, Whitehall and Cockspur Street, just south of Trafalgar Square. \n\nCharacteristics\n\nDefinitions\n\nLondon Plan\n\nThe London Plan defines the \"Central Activities Zone\" policy area, which comprises the City of London, most of Westminster and the inner parts of Camden, Islington, Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Lambeth and Kensington and Chelsea.  It is described as \"a unique cluster of vitally important activities including central government offices, headquarters and embassies, the largest concentration of London's financial and business services sector and the offices of trade, professional bodies, institutions, associations, communications, publishing, advertising and the media\". \n\nFor strategic planning, since 2011 there has been a Central London sub region comprising the boroughs of Camden, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Southwark, Westminster and the City of London.  From 2004 to 2008, the London Plan included a sub-region called Central London comprising Camden, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Southwark, Wandsworth and Westminster. It had a 2001 population of 1,525,000. The sub-region was replaced in 2008 with a new structure which amalgamated inner and outer boroughs together. This was altered in 2011 when a new Central London sub region was created, now including the City of London and excluding Wandsworth. However, districts at the outer edge of this subregion such as Streatham, Dulwich and Holloway are not generally considered as Central London.\n\nCensus\n\nThe 1901 census defined Central London as the City of London and the metropolitan boroughs of Bermondsey, Bethnal Green, Finsbury, Holborn, Shoreditch, Southwark, Stepney, St Marylebone and Westminster. \n\n1959\u20131963 proposals for a Central London borough\n\nDuring the Herbert Commission and the subsequent passage of the London Government Bill, three attempts were made to define an area that would form a central London borough. The first two were detailed in the 1959 Memorandum of Evidence of the Greater London Group of the London School of Economics. \n\n'Scheme A' envisaged a central London borough, one of 25, consisting of the City of London, Westminster, Holborn, Finsbury and the inner parts of St Marylebone, St Pancras, Chelsea, Southwark and Lambeth. The boundary deviated from existing lines in order to include all central London railway stations, the Tower of London and the museums, such that it included small parts of Kensington, Shoreditch, Stepney and Bermondsey. It had an estimated population of 350,000 and occupied 7000 acre. \n\n'Scheme B' delineated central London, as one of 7 boroughs, including most of the City of London, the whole of Finsbury and Holborn, most of Westminster and Southwark, parts of St Pancras, St Marylebone, Paddington and a small part of Kensington. The area had an estimated population of 400,000 and occupied 8000 acre.\n\nDuring the passage of the London Government Bill an amendment was put forward to create a central borough corresponding to the definition used at the 1961 census. It consisted of the City of London, all of Westminster, Holborn and Finsbury; and the inner parts of Shoreditch, Stepney, Bermondsey, Southwark, Lambeth, Chelsea, Kensington, Paddington, St Marylebone and St Pancras. The population was estimated to be 270,000.\nQuestion:\nWhat central London street is famous for containing the main government offices?\nAnswer:\nVerge of the Palaces of St James and Whitehall\nPassage:\nEra (geology)\nA geologic era is a subdivision of geologic time that divides an eon into smaller units of time. The Phanerozoic Eon is divided into three such time frames: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic represent the major stages in the macroscopic fossil record. These eras are separated by catastrophic extinction boundaries, the P-T boundary between the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic and the K-T boundary between the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic. There is evidence that catastrophic meteorite impacts played a role in demarcating the differences between the eras.\n\nThe Hadean, Archean and Proterozoic eons were as a whole formerly called the Precambrian. This covered the four billion years of Earth history prior to the appearance of hard-shelled animals. More recently, however, those eons have been subdivided into eras of their own.\n\nList of geological eras in Earth's evolutionary history\nQuestion:\nWhich geological era, spanning the massive time-period between 245 million and 65 million years ago, is divided into three periods named the Triassic, the Jurassic and the Cretaceous ?\nAnswer:\nTHE MESOZOIC ERA\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nfagot - Wiktionary\nfagot - Wiktionary\nfagot\nWhat fool hath added water to the sea, \\ Or brought a fagot to bright-burning Troy?\nAlternative form of faggot (shrivelled old woman)\nAlternative form of faggot (a gay person, particularly a man)\nA bundle of pieces of wrought iron to be worked over into bars or other shapes by rolling or hammering at a welding heat; a pile .\n(music, obsolete ) A fagotto , or bassoon .\n( Britain , obsolete ) A person hired to take the place of another at the muster of a company .\n(Can we find and add a quotation of Addison to this entry?)\nQuestion:\nWhich musical instrument has an Italian name fagotto which means a 'bundle of sticks'?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
