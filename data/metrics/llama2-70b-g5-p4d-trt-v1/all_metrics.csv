It depicts Jesus Christ on the cross in a darkened sky floating over a body of water complete with a boat and fishermen. Although it is a depiction of the crucifixion, it is devoid of nails, blood, and a crown of thorns, because, according to Dalí, he was convinced by a dream that these features would mar his depiction of Christ. Also in a dream, the importance of depicting Christ in the extreme angle evident in the painting was revealed to him.\n\nTitle\n\nThe painting is known as the Christ of Saint John of the Cross, because its design is based on a drawing by the 16th-century Spanish friar John of the Cross. The composition of Christ is also based on a triangle and circle (the triangle is formed by Christ\'s arms; the circle is formed by Christ\'s head). The triangle, since it has three sides, can be seen as a reference to the Trinity, and the circle may be an allusion to Platonic thought. The circle represents Unity: all things do exist in the ""three"" but in the four, merry they be. \n\nInspiration\n\nOn the bottom of his studies for the painting, Dalí explained its inspiration: ""In the first place, in 1950, I had a \'cosmic dream\' in which I saw this image in colour and which in my dream represented the \'nucleus of the atom.\'  This nucleus later took on a metaphysical sense; I considered it \'the very unity of the universe,\' the Christ!"" \n\nIn order to create the figure of Christ, Dalí had Hollywood stuntman Russell Saunders suspended from an overhead gantry, so he could see how the body would appear from the desired angle  and also envisage the pull of gravity on the human body. The depicted body of water is the bay of Port Lligat, Dalí\'s residence at the time of the painting. \n\nHistory\n\nThe painting and intellectual property rights were acquired for Glasgow Corporation in the early 1950s by Tom Honeyman, then the Director of Glasgow Museums. Honeyman got the painting for £8,200, a price considered high at the time although it was less than the £12,000 catalogue price, and included the copyright, which has earned Glasgow Museums back the original cost many times over.\n\nThe purchase was controversial. A petition against the purchase, arguing that the money should be spent on exhibition space for local artists, was presented to the City Council by students at Glasgow School of Art.  The controversy caused Honeyman and Dalí to become friends, corresponding with each other for many years after the original events.\n\nThe painting first went on display at the city\'s Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum on 23 June 1952. In 1961, a visitor attacked the painting with a stone and tore the canvas with his hands. It was successfully restored over several months by conservators at Kelvingrove and returned to public display.  In 1993, the painting was moved to the city\'s St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art, but returned to Kelvingrove for its reopening in July 2006. It won a poll to decide Scotland\'s favourite painting in 2006, with 29% of the vote. \n\nCritical reception\n\nThis painting has continued to generate controversy. At the time of its purchase by Honeyman, the verdict by Modern Art critics was that producing such a traditional painting was a stunt by an artist already famous for his surrealist art. In 2009 the Guardian art critic, Jonathan Jones, described it as ""kitsch and lurid,"" but noted that the painting was ""for better or worse, probably the most enduring vision of the crucifixion painted in the 20th century.""\n\nIn May 2013, in BBC Radio 4\'s Great Lives, British poet John Cooper Clarke described this image as being utterly different from any other image of the crucifixion, as the angle of view conveys the hanging pain of this method of execution, whilst hiding the ordinarily clichéd facial expressions normally seen in such depictions. \n\nSpanish offer\n\nThe Spanish government is said to have offered £80 million ($127 million USD) for the painting, but the offer was turned down.\nQuestion:\nWhich 20th century artist\'s works include \'Christ Of St. John Of The Cross\' and \'Metamorphosis Of Narcissus\'?\nAnswer:\nSalvador Felipe Jacinto DalA\nPassage:\nGreen Mountains\nThe Green Mountains are a mountain range in the U.S. state of Vermont. The range runs primarily south to north and extends approximately 250 mi from the border with Massachusetts to that with Quebec, Canada. The part of the range that is in Massachusetts is known as The Berkshires,  and the part in Quebec is called the Sutton Mountains, or Monts Sutton. \n\nAll mountains in Vermont are often referred to as the ""Green Mountains"". However, other ranges within Vermont, including the Taconics — in southwestern Vermont\'s extremity — and Northeastern Highlands, are not geologically part of the Green Mountains.\n\nPeaks\n\nThe best-known mountains – for reasons such as high elevation, ease of public access by road or trail (especially the Long Trail and Appalachian Trail), or with ski resorts or towns nearby – in the range include: \n*Mount Mansfield, 4393 ft, the highest point in Vermont\n*Killington Peak, 4235 ft\n*Mount Ellen, 4083 ft\n*Camel\'s Hump, 4083 ft\n*Mount Abraham, 4017 ft\n*Pico Peak, 3957 ft\n*Stratton Mountain, 3940 ft, the mountain at which the initial ideas of both the Long Trail and the Appalachian Trail were born\n*Jay Peak, 3862 ft, receives the most amount of snowfall on average in the eastern United States  \n*Bread Loaf Mountain, 3835 ft\n*Mount Wilson, 3780 ft\n*Glastenbury Mountain, 3748 ft\n\nThe Green Mountains are part of the Appalachian Mountains, a range that stretches from Quebec in the north to Alabama in the south.\n\nThe Green Mountains are part of the New England/Acadian forests ecoregion.\n\nThree peaks, Mount Mansfield, Camel\'s Hump, and Mount Abraham, support alpine vegetation.\n\nTourism\n\nSome of the mountains are developed for skiing and other snow-related activities. Others have hiking trails for use in summer.  Mansfield, Killington, Pico, and Ellen have downhill ski resorts on their slopes. All of the major peaks are traversed by the Long Trail, a wilderness hiking trail that runs from the southern to northern borders of the state and is overlapped by the Appalachian Trail for roughly  of its length.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Vermont Republic, also known as the Green Mountain Republic,  existed from 1777 to 1791, at which time Vermont became the 14th state.\n\nVermont not only takes its state nickname (""The Green Mountain State"") from the mountains, it is named after them. The French Verts Monts is literally translated as ""Green Mountains"". This name was suggested in 1777 by Dr. Thomas Young, an American revolutionary and Boston Tea Party participant.  The University of Vermont and State Agricultural College is referred to as UVM, after the Latin Universitas Viridis Montis (University of the Green Mountains). \n\nGeology and physiography\n\nThe Green Mountains are a physiographic section of the larger New England province, which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian physiographic division. \n\nLemon Fair runs through the towns of Orwell, Sudbury, Shoreham, Bridport, and Cornwall, Vermont, before flowing into Otter Creek. The story is that its name derives from early English-speaking settlers\' phonetic approximation of \'Les Monts Vert\'.\nQuestion:\nWhich American state has the nickname the Green Mountain state?\nAnswer:\nSports in Vermont\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nMay Birthstone | Emerald - American Gem Society\nMay Birthstone\nMay Birthstone\nMay Birthstone\nMay birthdays fall right in the heart of spring, and the emerald is the perfect gem to symbolize and celebrate this month.

It consists of a joint introductory paper (reprinted from 1893); followed by five individual studies of ""hysterics"" – Breuer\'s famous case of Anna O. (real name: Bertha Pappenheim), seminal for the development of psychoanalysis, and four more by Freud; and finishing with a theoretical essay by Breuer and a more practice-oriented one on therapy by Freud. \n\nSummary\n\nFreud sees symptomology as stratified in an almost geological way, with the outermost strata being easily remembered and accepted, while “the deeper one goes the more difficult it is to recognise the recollections that are surfacing”. \n\nReception and influence\n\nBreuer\'s work with Bertha Pappenheim provided the founding impetus for psychoanalysis, as Freud himself would acknowledge.  In their preliminary (1893) paper, both men agreed that “the hysteric suffers mainly from reminiscences”.  Freud however would come to lay more stress on the causative role of sexuality in producing hysteria, as well as gradually repudiating Breuer\'s use of hypnosis as a means of treatment.  Some of the theoretical scaffolding of the Studies – ""strangulated affect"", hypnoid state  – would be abandoned with the crystallisation of psychoanalysis as an independent technique.  However, many of Freud’s clinical observations – on mnenmic symbols  or deferred action  for example – would continue to be confirmed in his later work. At the same time, Breuer’s theoretical essay, with its examination of the principle of constancy, and its differentiation of bound and mobile cathexis,  would continue to inform Freud’s thinking as late as the twenties and the writing of Beyond the Pleasure Principle.\n\nAt the time of its release, Studies on Hysteria tended to polarise opinion, both within and outside by the medical community.  While many were critical, Havelock Ellis offered an appreciative account, while a leading Viennese paper would characterise the work as “the kind of psychology used by poets”.  Studies on Hysteria received a positive review from psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, although Bleuler nevertheless suggested that the results Freud and Breuer reported could have been the result of suggestion. Philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and psychologist Sonu Shamdasani comment that Studies on Hysteria gave Freud, ""a certain local and international notoriety"". Borch-Jacobsen and Shamdasani write that, contrary to what Freud and Breuer claimed, Freud ""always knew that the treatment of Bertha Pappenheim...had not been an unmitigated success"".\nQuestion:\n""Who wrote the book """"Studies in Hysteria"""" and """"Interpretation of Dreams""""?""\nAnswer:\nZigi Frojd\nPassage:\nHablot Knight Browne\nHablot Knight Browne (10 July 1815 – 8 July 1882) was an English artist.  Well-known by his pen name, Phiz, he illustrated books by Charles Dickens, Charles Lever, and Harrison Ainsworth.\n\nBiography\n\nOf Huguenot ancestry, Hablot Knight Browne was born in England, in Lambeth (near London) on Kennington Lane.  He was the fourteenth of Catherine and William Loder Browne\'s fifteen children. According to Valerie Browne Lester, Phiz was in fact the illegitimate son of his putative eldest sister Kate and Captain Nicholas Hablot of Napoleon\'s Imperial Guard. There is some uncertainty regarding the exact date of birth. 10 July 1815 is the date given by Valerie Browne Lester, his great-great-granddaughter. John Buchanan-Brown in his book Phiz!: illustrator of Dickens\' world says 12 July 1815. The date on his Christening record of 21 December 1815 at St Mary\'s Church, Lambeth, Surrey, England gives 11 June 1815, as does the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition and 15 June 1815 (Dictionary of National Biography). A copy of the program from his burial service, which is still owned by the Browne family, says he was born 10 July 1815. \n\nWhen he was 7 years old, his father William Browne abandoned his family, changed his name to Breton and sailed with embezzled funds to Philadelphia where he became known for his watercolour paintings. William Browne was then declared dead by his wife Catherine. \nThomas Moxon, husband of William\'s sister Ann Loder Browne, helped to support the family, who were left badly off.\n\nBrowne was apprenticed to William Finden, an engraver, in whose studio he obtained his only artistic education. However, he was unsuited for engraving, and having during 1833 secured an important prize from the Society of Arts for a drawing of John Gilpin, he abandoned engraving in the following year and began other artistic work, with the ultimate object of becoming a painter.\n\nArtistic career\n\nIn the spring of 1836, he met Charles Dickens. It was at the time when Dickens was looking for someone to illustrate  Pickwick. Browne had been the illustrator of his little pamphlet Sunday under Three Heads. In the original edition of Pickwick, issued in shilling monthly parts from early in 1836 until the end of 1837, the first seven plates were drawn by Robert Seymour,  who committed suicide in April 1836. The next two plates were by Robert William Buss.\n\nBrowne and William Makepeace Thackeray visited the publishers\' office with specimens of their work for Dickens\'s inspection. The novelist preferred Browne. Browne\'s first two etched plates for Pickwick were signed ""Nemo,"" but the third was signed ""Phiz,"" a pseudonym which was retained in future. When asked to explain why he chose this name he answered that the change from ""Nemo"" to ""Phiz"" was made to harmonize better with Dickens\'s ""Boz.""\n\nPhiz developed the character Sam Weller graphically just as Seymour had developed Pickwick. Dickens and Phiz became good friends and in 1838 travelled together to Yorkshire to see the schools of which Nicholas Nickleby became the hero: afterwards they made several journeys of this nature in company to facilitate the illustrator\'s work. Other Dickens characters illustrated by Phiz were Squeers, Micawber, Guppy, Major Bagstock, Mrs Gamp, Tom Pinch and David Copperfield.\n\nOf the ten books by Dickens which Phiz illustrated, he is most known for David Copperfield, Pickwick, Dombey and Son, Martin Chuzzlewit and Bleak House. Browne made several drawings for Punch in his early days and also towards the end of his life. He designed the wrapper which was used for eighteen months from January 1842. He also contributed to Punch\'s Pocket Books.\n\nIn addition to his work for Dickens, Phiz illustrated more than twenty of Lever\'s novels (among them Harry Lorrequer, Charles O\'Malley, Jack Hinton and the Knight of Gwynne). He also illustrated Harrison Ainsworth\'s and Frank Smedley\'s novels. Mervyn Clitheroe by Ainsworth is one of the most accomplished of the artist\'s works. Browne was in continual employment by publishers until 1867, when he suffered an illness that caused a degree of paralysis. After recovering, he produced many woodcuts. In 1878 he was awarded an annuity by the Royal Academy. His health gradually worsened until he died on 8 July 1882.\n\nMost of Browne\'s work was etched on steel plates because these yielded a far larger edition than copper. Browne was annoyed at some of his etchings being transferred to stone by the publishers and printed as lithographic reproductions. Partly with the view to prevent this treatment of his work, he employed a machine to rule a series of lines over the plate in order to obtain what appeared to be a tint; when manipulated with acid this tint gave an effect somewhat resembling mezzotint, which at that time it was found practically impossible to transfer to stone.\n\nFour of his illustrations were issued as stamps by the Royal Mail in 2012 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens. \n\nGallery\n\nFile:Phiz-Sarony- 1870s.jpg|Browne photographed by Sarony c.1870s\nImage:Hablot Knight Browne blue plaque.jpg|Blue plaque, Ladbroke Grove, London\nFile:Phiz Auriol.jpg|Scene from Auriol by Harrison Ainsworth, 1844\nFile:Pelham.jpg|Frontispiece to Pelham by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1849\nQuestion:\nWhat was the pen name of the illustrator Hablot Knight-Brown?\nAnswer:\nHablot Knight Browne\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nTop 10 Blondie Songs - Ultimate Classic Rock\nTop 10 Blondie Songs\nTop 10 Blondie Songs\nREDDIT\nMichael Ochs Archives, Getty Images\nBack in the late ’70s, music was on a collision course of genres that would forever divide charts, playlists and fans.

On the North Shore toddlers ride this trail on a tricycle. John Gibson photo.\nThe IMBA Trail Difficulty Rating System is a basic method used to categorize the relative technical difficulty of recreation trails. The IMBA Trail Difficulty Rating System can:\nHelp trail users make informed decisions\nEncourage visitors to use trails that match their skill level\nManage risk and minimize injuries\nImprove the outdoor experience for a wide variety of visitors\nAid in the planning of trails and trail systems\nThis system was adapted from the International Trail Marking System used at ski areas throughout the world. Many trail networks use this type of system, most notably resort-based mountain biking trail networks. The system best applies to mountain bikers, but is also applicable to other visitors such as hikers and equestrians. These criteria should be combined with personal judgment and trail-user input to reach the final rating.\nTrail Rating Guidelines\n1. Rate Technical Challenge Only.\nThe system focuses on rating the technical challenge of trails, not the physical exertion. It is not practical to rate both types of difficulty with one system. Consider, for example, a smooth, wide trail that is 20 miles long. The technical challenge of this trail is easy, yet the distance would make the physical exertion difficult. The solution is to independently rate technical challenge, and indicate physical exertion by posting trail length, and possibly even elevation change.\n2. Collect Trail Measurements.\nUse the accompanying table and collect trail measurements for each criteria. There is no prescribed method for tallying a ""score"" for each trail. Evaluate the trail against the table and combine with judgment to reach the final rating. It is unlikely that any particular trail will measure at the same difficulty level for every criteria. For example, a certain trail may rate as a green circle in three criteria, but a blue square in two different criteria.\n3. Include Difficulty and Trail Length on Signs and Maps.\nTrail length is not a criterion of the system. Instead, trail length should be posted on signs in addition to the difficulty symbol. A sign displaying both length and difficulty provides lots of information, yet it is simple to create and easy to understand.\nLikewise, elevation change is not a criterion. The amount of climbing on a trail is more an indicator of physical exertion than technical difficulty. Mountainous regions may consider including the amount of climbing on trail signs.\n4. Evaluate Difficulty Relative to Local Trails.\nTrails should be rated relative to other trails in the region. Don\'t evaluate each trail in isolation. Consider all the trails in a region and how they compare to one another. This will help you rank the relative difficulty of each trail and will help trail users select an appropriate route. Trails will rate differently from region to region. A black diamond trail in one region may rate as a blue square in another region, but the ratings should be consistent locally.\n5. Use Good Judgment.\nRating a trail is not 100 percent objective. Its best to combine tangible data with subjective judgment to reach the final rating. For example, a trail may have a wide range of tread surfaces - most of the trail is easy, but some sections are more difficult. How would you rate it? Use your personal experience to consider all elements and select a rating that best matches the style of trail.\n6. Consider Other Trail Qualities.\nDon\'t forget to consider trail qualities beyond the objective criteria. A wide variety of features could contribute to a trail\'s difficulty. For example, exposure - the feeling of empty space next to and below the trail tread - provides an added psychological challenge beyond the steepness or roughness of the trail. A 3-inch rock seems like a boulder when a 50-foot drop looms on your side! Other qualities to think about are corridor clearance and turn radius.\n7. Use Common Sense and Seek Input.\nNo rating system can be totally objective or valid for every situation. This system is a tool to be combined with common sense. Look at trails with a discerning eye, and seek input from trail users before selecting the rating. Remember, a diverse trail network with a variety of trail styles is a great way to ensure happy visitors. Provide both easy and difficult trails to spread visitors and meet a range of needs. By indicating the length and difficulty of trails with a clear signage system, visitors will be able to locate their preferred type of trail easily.\nCriteria to Consider\nQuestion:\nIn skiing, what colour diamond denotes an expert trail on signs and trail maps?\nAnswer:\nBlackishly\nPassage:\nChemical Elements.com - Phosphorus (P)\nChemical Elements.com - Phosphorus (P)\nContains an ""Introduction to Tungsten"", among other things\nIf you know of any other links for Phosphorus, please let me know\nBentor, Yinon.

He began his career on the European and Southern African tours, but had little success as a player. Having an interest in the techniques, mechanics and psychology of the sport he soon moved into instruction and came to wide notice in the 1980s when he rebuilt the swing of  Nick Faldo, who then went on to win six major championships.\n\nLeadbetter now runs an international chain of golf academies headquartered at the ChampionsGate Golf Club in Davenport, Florida, U.S. which has 36 holes designed by Greg Norman. There are also branches elsewhere in North America and in Europe and Asia. Leadbetter himself concentrates on teaching tour professionals and on instructing other coaches in his methods, who then teach his ideas at his academies. Apart from Faldo his students include Nick Price, Charles Howell III, Michelle Wie, Lydia Ko and Byeong Hun An. Pros who formerly worked with Leadbetter included: Nick Faldo (1984–1998), Greg Norman (1997), and Ernie Els (1990–2008). He was ranked second to Butch Harmon on the 2005-2006 edition of Golf Digest\'s list of the ""50 Greatest Teachers"" in the United States. \n\nLeadbetter has published several books and produced numerous instructional videos and DVDs. His latest book is [http://www.leadbetterAswing.com The A Swing], The Alternative Approach to Great Golf.\n\nLeadbetter and his wife, Kelly (an LPGA Tour professional), their sons Andy and James and their daughter Hally, live in Sarasota, Florida. He is also an endorser/spokesman for SAP, Epson, Callaway, JoS. A. Bank Clothiers, Rolex, and Golf Pride grips.\nQuestion:\nDavid Leadbetter is a famous coach, in which sport?\nAnswer:\nScramble (golf)\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nDanube Waltz River Cruise Videos - 2017 Passau to Budapest\nDanube Waltz River Cruise Videos - 2017 Passau to Budapest\nDanube Waltz River Cruise Videos - 2017 Passau to Budapest\nCall Viking at\nGrand Voyages\nCruise Danube Waltz Explore four of Europe’s most enchanting countries along the storied Danube River; Austria, Germany, Hungary and Slovakia.

He is the god who planted the tree of life called Ulukayın. Kayra is described as both father and mother, and resides in the 17th layer of heaven.He is the supreme god of the pantheon and the son of sky deity named Tengri. This son, Kara Han (the black king or ruler of the land – Kara may mean land, earth, black or in a sense strong, powerful), left his father\'s home in the heaven and went to live in the underworld. On occasion, identified as Kara-Khan (black king), he was the primordial god and his father was the ancordial god called Tengri.\n\nEtymology\nThe name of this deity is found in several forms, as is that of his opponent. ""Kayra-Khan"" may be translated as ""merciful king"", while the form ""Kara Han"" signifies ""black king"". For this reason, authority on Turkic Mythology Deniz Karakurt, considers Kara-Han and Kayra-Han to be two different deities. Furthermore, the Turkish word kara can mean both black and land, with the result that Kara Han can mean not only \'Black (Dark) Ruler\' but also \'Ruler of the Land\'.\n\nGod of Creation\nIn ancient Turkic  belief known as Altai myth of creation, Tangri (God) Kara Han is neither male nor female nor even human in form, but a pure-white goose that flies constantly over an endless expanse of water (time), the benign creator of all that is, including the other, lesser gods. Among all Altai people the dualistic division is most clear (Ulgen and Erlik), and the highest god, Tengre Kaira Khan, is a good power. But before Ak Ana appears to urge it to create, Kara-han becomes anxious, creation occurring in a context of loneliness, turmoil and fear: the water becomes turbulent, but it reassures itself that it ""need not fear"" (the implication of such self-reassurance being that it is indeed afraid). Supreme being in the universe it created, Kara-han is the ruler of the three realms of air, water and land, seated on the seventeenth level of the universe, from which it determines the fate of its creation. After creating the universe it planted the nine-boughed tree of life, from the branches of which came the ancestors of humans. Thus emerged the nine races (nine clans).\nIt has three sons: Ulgan, Mergen and Kyzaghan.\nA Tuvinian / Soyoth legend, told as follows: The giant turtle which supported the earth moved, which caused the cosmic ocean to begin flooding the earth. An old man who had guessed something like this would happen, built a raft. Boarded it with his family, and he was saved. When the waters receded, the raft was left on a high wooded mountain, where, it is said, it remains today. After the flood Kaira-Khan created everything around the world. Among other things, he taught people how to make Araq (some kind of liquor).\n\nSee also\nBai-Ulgan\nTurul\nPassage 6:\nBlack King\nBlack King may refer to:\n\nThe black king (chess)\nA black king (playing card), either the King of Spades or the King of Clubs\nBlack King (comics), a number of comics characters\nBlack King, a character in Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror\nBlack King (Ultra monster), a kaiju from Return of Ultraman\nLampropeltis getula, the Black King Snake\nThe Black King (film), a 1932 race film starring A.B.

Most of the major lakes in Africa lie along a continental fault line known as the East African Rift Valley, which runs through the southeastern portion of the continent, creating both spectacular mountains such as Kilimanjaro and a system of deep lakes known collectively as the Great Lakes of Africa. While not quite as large as the North American Great Lakes system, the system nonetheless looms significant in both the physical and economic geography of the continent -- and that\'s not to mention its physical beauty and stature.\nLake Victoria\nNot only is Lake Victoria the largest lake in Africa, it is the second-largest freshwater lake in terms of area in the world. Bordered by Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, it supports a diverse ecosystem of reefs and islands, including many unique species of fish. Lake Victoria is also one of the sources of the Nile River. The land around Lake Victoria is densely populated, and the lake plays an important economic role in the lives of the people there. For tourists, sport fishing for Nile perch is a major attraction, as is birdwatching.\nLake Tanganyika\nLake Tanganyika is one of the 10 largest freshwater lakes in the world and the second deepest. Long and narrow -- in fact, the longest lake in the world -- it forms the entirety of the border between Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and also borders Burundi to the north and Zambia to the south. The lake\'s warm blue waters make it especially attractive to swimmers; sport fishing is also a draw.\nLake Nyasa\nLike Lake Victoria, Lake Nyasa -- also known as Lake Malawi -- is part of the African Great Lakes system. It\'s the third-largest lake in the East African Rift Valley system, bordered by Malawi, Tanzania and Mozambique. Nyasa means ""lake"" in Bantu. The Malawi beaches are well-established tourist attractions, while Tanzanian beaches such as Matema Beach tend to be less developed.\nLake Albert\nLake Albert is also sometimes known as Lake Mobutu Sese Seko. The lake is relatively shallow, reaching only 80 feet in depth, but in terms of surface area it\'s the fourth largest of the Rift Valley lakes. Its significant also for acting as a source of the White Nile river. Lake Albert borders Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Due to the terrain, which includes steep surrounding mountains, the shores of Lake Albert are sparsely populated, and the area is off the beaten path in terms of tourism, but visitors might be interested in the wildlife and forest preserves that surround the lake, as well as Muchison Falls National Park.\nLake Chad\nLake Chad is northern Africa\'s largest lake in terms of area, but it is strikingly shallow, reaching only 34 feet at its deepest point. This is in part because Lake Chad is surrounded by the arid Sahara Desert. In fact, the exact dimensions of the lake can vary widely from year to year depending on the local drought conditions. Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria and Niger share a border with the lake. Lake Chad is a vital wildlife sanctuary, and birdwatchers will find much to occupy themselves here. The best time to visit is during the rainy season, roughly August to December, when the water level is high.\nReferences\nQuestion:\nWhich is the largest lake in Africa?\nAnswer:\nSouthern Victoria Nyanza\nPassage:\nBoy Scout Motto - U.S. Scouting Service Project\nBoy Scout Motto\nBoy Scout Motto\nBe Prepared: The Motto of the Boy Scouts of America\nExcerpted from page 54, Boy Scout Handbook, 11th ed,\n(#33105), copyright 1998 by BSA, ISBN 0-8395-3105-2\nBe Prepared.\nThat\'s the motto of the Boy Scouts.\n""Be prepared for what?"" someone once asked Baden-Powell, the founder of     Scouting,\n""Why, for any old thing."" said Baden-Powell.\nThe training you receive in your troop will help you\xa0 live up to the Scout motto.     When someone has an accident, you are prepared because of your first aid instruction.     Because of lifesaving practice, you might be able to save a nonswimmer who has fallen into     deep water.\nBut Baden-Powell wasn\'t thinking just of being ready for emergencies. His idea was that     all Scouts should prepare themselves to become productive citizens and to give happiness     to other people. He wanted each Scout to be ready in mind and body for any struggles, and     to meet with a strong heart whatever challenges might lie ahead.\nBe prepared for life - to live happily and without regret, knowing that you have     done your best.

A country bumpkin, he is arrested in the first scene for flouting the king\'s proclamation that all men of the court avoid the company of women for three years.  While in custody, the men of the court use him to further their own romantic endeavors.  By sending love notes to the wrong women and blurting out secrets (including that of an unplanned pregnancy), Costard makes fools of the royal court.  Along with Moth the page and Jaquenetta, a country wench, Costard pokes fun at the upper-class.  While mocking a pedantic schoolmaster, Costard uses the word honorificabilitudinitatibus, the longest word by far from any of Shakespeare\'s works.\n\nCostard makes many clever puns, and is used as a tool by Shakespeare to explain new words such as remuneration. He is sometimes considered one of the smartest characters in the play due to his wit and wordplay.\n\nCostard\'s name is an archaic term for apple, or metaphorically a man\'s head.

From his birth in 63 B.C. he was Octavius; after his adoption was announced in 44 B.C., Octavian; and beginning in 26 B.C. the Roman Senate conferred on him the name Augustus, the august or exalted one. He was born Gaius Octavius Thurinus in Velletri, 20 miles from Rome. His father was a senator and governor in the Roman Republic. His mother Atai was Caesar’s niece, and the young Octavius was raised in part by his grandmother Julia Ceasaris, Caesar’s sister.\nDid You Know?\nIn 8 B.C. Augustus had the Roman month of Sextilius renamed after himself—as his great-uncle and predecessor Julius Caesar had done with July. August was the month of several of the emperor\'s greatest victories, including the defeat and suicide of Antony and Cleopatra. He did not increase the month\'s length, which had been 31 days since the establishment of the Julian calendar in 45 B.C.\nOctavius donned the toga, the Roman sign of manhood, at age 16, and began taking on responsibilities through his family connections. In 47 B.C. he went to Hispania (modern-day Spain) to fight alongside Caesar. He was shipwrecked along the way, and had to cross enemy territory to reach his great-uncle—an act that impressed Caesar enough to name Octavius his heir and successor in his will.\nAugustus: The Path to Power\nThe 17-year-old Octavius was at Apollonia (in present-day Albania) when the news of Caesar’s death and his own inheritance arrived. The dead ruler’s allies, including many in the senate, rallied around Octavian against their powerful rival Mark Antony . But after Octavian’s troops defeated Antony’s army in northern Italy, the future emperor refused an all-out pursuit of Antony, preferring an uneasy alliance with his rival.\nIn 43 B.C. Octavian, Antony and Marcus Aemilus Lepidus established the Second Triumvirate, a power-sharing agreement that divided up Rome’s territories among them, with Antony given the East, Lepidus Africa and Octavian the West. In 41 B.C. Antony began a romantic and political alliance with Cleopatra , queen of Egypt, which continued even after a Senatorial decree forced his marriage to Octavian’s sister Octavia Minor. Lepidus remained a minor figure until Octavian finally had him ousted after the triumvirate’s renewal in 37 B.C.\nAntony’s affair with Cleopatra continued, and in 32 B.C. he divorced Octavia. In retaliation, Octavian declared war on Cleopatra. In the naval battle of Actium a year later, Octavian’s fleet, under his admiral Agrippa, cornered and defeated Antony’s ships. Cleopatra’s navy raced to aid her ally, but in the end the two lovers barely escaped. They returned to Egypt and committed suicide, leaving Octavian as Rome’s undisputed ruler.\nAugustus: Emperor in All but Name\nHistorians date the start of Octavian’s monarchy to either 31 B.C. (the victory at Actium) or 27 B.C., when he was granted the name Augustus. In that four-year span, Octavian secured his rule on multiple fronts. Cleopatra’s seized treasure allowed him to pay his soldiers, securing their loyalty. To mollify Rome’s Senate and ruling classes, he passed laws harkening back—at least on the surface—to the traditions of the Roman Republic. And to win over the people, he worked to improve and beautify the city of Rome.\nDuring his 40-years reign, Augustus nearly doubled the size of the empire, adding territories in Europe and Asia Minor and securing alliances that gave him effective rule from Britain to India. He spent much of his time outside of Rome, consolidating power in the provinces and instituting a system of censuses and taxation that integrated the empire’s furthest reaches. He expanded the Roman network of roads, founded the Praetorian Guard and the Roman postal service and remade Rome with both grand (a new forum) and practical gestures (police and fire departments).\nAugustus: Family and Succession\nAugustus married three times, although his first union, to Mark Antony’s stepdaughter Clodia Pulchra, was unconsummated. His second wife, Scribonia, bore his only child, Julia the Elder. He divorced in 39 B.C. to marry Livia Drusilla, who had two sons—Tiberius and Drusus—by her first husband, Mark Antony’s ally Tiberius Claudius Nero . The family tree became more complicated after Augustus had his stepson Tiberius briefly marry his daughter, and then adopted Tiberius outright as son and successor in A.D. 4.\nAugustus Caesar died in A.D. 14, his empire secured and at peace. His reported last words were twofold: to his subjects he said, “I found Rome of clay; I leave it to you of marble,” but to the friends who had stayed with him in his rise to power he added, “Have I played the part well? Then applaud me as I exit.” Soon after that acknowledgement of human frailty, the Roman Senate officially declared their departed emperor, like Julius Caesar before him, to be a god.\nTags\nQuestion:\nWho was the first emperor of Rome?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 2101, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 2101, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 8}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705955300', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

""Parakeets""  or ""Keets"" is the term used for younger fans of Jimmy, or children of Parrotheads.\n\nOrigin of the term\n\nThe term ""Parrot Head"" was coined in 1985 at a Jimmy Buffett concert at the Timberwolf Amphitheater in Cincinnati, OH.  Buffett has said numerous times that he attributes much of his fame to this area. At the show, Jimmy commented about everyone wearing Hawaiian shirts and parrot hats and how they kept coming back to see his shows, just like Deadheads. Timothy B. Schmit, then a member of the Coral Reefer Band, coined the term ""Parrot Head"" to describe each of those fans.\n\nActivities\n\nEvents range from single act concerts or happy hours to the annual Meeting of the Minds in Key West, Florida, which attracts approximately 3,500 Parrotheads each year.  The several day event, sponsored by the Parrot Heads in Paradise includes live music, but also a Toy Drive for the Monroe County Salvation Army, a blood drive, Zonta Walk for Breast Cancer, raffles and other events to raise money for charities. Some regional groups will focus on one or two key charities, while others may switch between several.  Environmental causes, cancer research, Alzheimer\'s research and the March of Dimes all have received large donations from Parrothead organizations.  In 2011, there were 239 Parrothead Club chapters in the United States, Canada and Australia, spanning 3 different countries, 47 states and 3 Canadian provinces. The total membership in 2011 was almost 28,000 members. In the ten-year period 2002-2011, member clubs of the international Parrothead organization raised over $26.2M to support charitable organizations, and collectively worked almost 2.9 million hours of community service.  The Pikes Peak Hash House Harriers and Harriettes have an annual Parrot Head Hash weekend hosted by Yeastee Boy and Bread Box.\nQuestion:\nIf you were a parrothead, of what musician would you be a fan of?\nAnswer:\nJimmy buffett\nPassage:\nWhat Is A Dongle? - Business Insider\nWhat Is A Dongle? - Business Insider\nprint\n3 Dongles plugged into   Google\'s Chromebook Pixel. Kevin   Smith/Business Insider\nThis week two people in the tech industry lost their jobs because of jokes gone awry at a conference.\nA couple of male developers were joking around about ""big""   dongles. When a female developer evangelist heard their jokes she   tweeted it out with their photo, complaining that they were being   rude. One of those developers lost his job, and then eventually,   so did the evangelist.\nIn the developers\' defense, the word ""dongle"" is funny. It\'s   nearly impossible to say without giggling or making childish   jokes.\nSome people in our office had heard the word before, but didn\'t   know what a dongle is.

The ad claimed the word   dongle was derived from the name ""Don Gall.""

UPenn   clarifies:\nThe current meaning   for\xa0dongle\xa0seems   to be something like ""a self-contained device that plugs into   a\xa0 port on a computer that is normally used for connections   to a separate external device"". Thus in addition to the original   serial-port dongles, and the USB dongles that Suzanne (and   Stephen Fry) wrote about, there are also\xa0 ""firewire   dongles"" , and presumably there could be dongles for any   other sort of port as well.\xa0\nSimply put, dongles are computer peripherals that plug into   your computer like a USB flash drive or a cord connecting a   computer with a printer for example.\xa0 Dongles are also huge in the video game   world because they allow consoles to have added features like   increased audio quality.\nAn Xbox 360 Audio Dongle Wikimedia   Commons\nBefore USB was the standard in   attaching PC peripherals, there were tons of different dongles   that came in various shapes and sizes.\nQuestion:\nIn computing, what is the device which is plugged into a computer which serves as an adapter or to enable the use of certain software?\nAnswer:\nDongle\nPassage:\nEast Anglian Daily Times\nThe East Anglian Daily Times is a British local newspaper for Suffolk and Essex, based in Ipswich.\n\nIt started publication on 13 October 1874,  incorporating the Ipswich Express, which had been published since 13 August 1839.

In calculus terms, velocity is the first derivative of position with respect to time.\nThe most common way to calculate the constant velocity of an object moving in a straight line is with the formula:\nr = d / t\nwhere\nr is the rate, or speed (sometimes denoted as v, for velocity, as in this kinematics article )\nd is the distance moved\nt is the time it takes to complete the movement\nUnits of Velocity\nThe SI units for velocity are m / s (meters per second). It may be expressed in any units of distance per time. Other units include miles per hour (mph), kilometers per hour (kph), and kilometers per second (km/s).\nSample Velocity Problem\nA physics student drops an egg off an extremely tall building.\ncontinue reading below our video\n4 Tips for Improving Test Performance\nWhat is the egg\'s velocity after 2.60 seconds?\nThe hardest part about solving for velocity in a physics problem is selecting the right equation. In this case, two equations may be used to solve the problem.\nUsing the equation:\nd = vI*t + 0.5*a*t2\nwhere d is distance, vI is initial velocity, t is time, a is acceleration (due to gravity, in this case)\nd = (0 m/s)*(2.60 s) + 0.5*(-9.8 m/s2)(2.60 s)2\nd = -33.1 m (negative sign indicates direction downward)\nNext, you can plug in this distance value to solve for velocity using the equation:\nvf = vi + a*t\nwhere vf is final velocity, vi is initial velocity, a is acceleration, and t is time. Since the egg was dropped and not thrown, the initial velocity is 0.\nvf = 0 + (-9.8 m/s2)(2.60 s)\nvf = -25.5 m/s\nAlthough it\'s common to report velocity as a simple value, remember it\'s a vector and has direction as well as magnitude. Usually, moving upward is indicated with a positive sign, and down carries a negative sign.\nRelating Velocity, Speed, and Acceleration\nSpeed, velocity, and acceleration are all related to each other. Remember:\nSpeed is a scalar quantity that indicates rate of motion distance per time. Its units are length/time.\nVelocity is a vector quantity that indicates distance per time and direction. Like speed, its units are length/time, but direction is also cited.\nAcceleration is a vector quantity that indicates the rate of change of velocity. It has dimensions of length/time2.\nQuestion:\nIn physics, \'the rate of change of position\' is a basic definition of what term?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:', 'do_sample': True, 'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.92, 'top_k': 120, 'max_new_tokens': 100, 'truncate': 2440, 'completion': None, 'prompt_tokens': 2440, 'completion_tokens': None, 'latency': None, 'experiment_name': 'llama2-70b-g5.48xlarge-huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2.0.1-tgi1.1.0', 'concurrency': 8}, {'endpoint_name': 'llama-2-70b-g5-48xlarge-1705955300', 'prompt': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

He first said this in a theatre in Coventry. Fifty years later, deciding he needed a rest from the business (he planned a cruise around the world with his wife), he again said it in a Coventry theatre, for the last time.\n\nEarly life \n\nBorn Albert Arthur Powell in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England in 1900, he attended White\'s school in Masbrough where he helped his mother (stage name of Lily le Maine) to put on a marionette show. At age nine, she put him in a velvet suit with a lace collar and he went on stage and sang. After he left school he became a music hall entertainer, often wearing a kilt in the guise of a Scottish comedian. During this part of his career he was associated with the singer Gracie Fields, and released several records where he collaborated with her.\n\nStage and recording \n\nHe made a total of eighty five 78rpm records between 1929 and 1942,  mostly double-sided sketches with him in various occupations. He sold seven and a half million records, earning a penny a side, so over £60,000. The first, The Lost Policeman on the cheap Broadcast label, sold almost half a million copies (he had turned down a flat fee of £60 for this), and his subsequent recordings for Broadcast and Rex were extremely popular. He said in a 1982 interview  that he used his stage work to advertise the records, rather than the other way about, though it was later said of him that his records introduced him so wherever he went to put on a show, they already knew him..\n\nSandy had a stooge in his act during the 1930s, the boy soprano, Jimmy Fletcher, father of the actor Gerard Fletcher, of Emmerdale, Coronation Street and other TV. From 1930 he took his own revue, Sandy Powell\'s Road Show, on tour – it ran for ten years and was extremely popular despite having only a handful of performers and two backdrops.\n\nRadio and film \n\nIn the 1930s he began to work on the radio, always introducing his show with catchphrase Can You Hear Me, Mother? Powell said that the catchphrase originated on an occasion when he had dropped his script and was killing time at the microphone while rearranging the pages. It is also attributed to his mother\'s coercion and her hardness of hearing, during his early career. At his next booking, the theatre manager asked him to say it again as everyone was saying it now. He also appeared in a number of films during the 1930s, usually as himself. In 1939 he was voted the fifth most popular British star at the local box office. \n\nA popular figure, he worked continually on radio, television and pantomime through the 1940s and 1950s. Aged 21 at the time, Pat Phoenix was brought in to play Sandy\'s wife and played four parts in the film. After that he want onto a variety tour and she came with him as his wife, earning £12 a week. He performed with his Starlight company in the Eastbourne Pier theatre for over fifteen seasons in the 1950s and 1960s, earning himself the sobriquet \'Mr Eastbourne\', and he was still performing occasionally up to his death in 1982. Part of his act was a comedy ventriloquism act, where the dummy would fall apart. After being on stage for a few weeks with a series of awful ventriloquists, he bought a dummy himself and did his own act as a ventriloquist. When Pat Phoenix as his wife who ""fed him lines"" asked if the dummy could sing something, he replied ""If I know it, he can sing it!""\n\nHonour \n\nHe was still well-known enough to have a pub in his home town of Rotherham [http://www.rotherhampubs.f9.co.uk/Comedian.html dedicated to him] in 1970 and was awarded the MBE in 1975. \n\nDeath\n\nFor a day or two, he thought he had bad indigestion but it was worse than he realised and he died of a heart attack on 26 June 1982.\n\nSelected filmography\n\n*The Third String (1932)\n* Soft Lights and Sweet Music (1936)\n*It\'s a Grand Old World (1937)\n*I\'ve Got a Horse (1938)\n*Home from Home (1939)\n*Cup-tie Honeymoon (1948)\nQuestion:\nWhose catchphrase was \'Can you hear me Mother\'?\nAnswer:\nSandy Powell (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nAmy Williams\nAmy Joy Williams MBE (born 29 September 1982)  is a British former skeleton racer and Olympic gold medallist.\n\nOriginally a runner, she began training in skeleton after trying the sport on a push-start track at the University of Bath. Although unable to qualify for the 2006 Winter Olympics, she was a member of her nation\'s team four years later at the 2010 Games, and won a gold medal, becoming the first British individual gold medallist at a Winter Olympics for 30 years and the only British medallist of those specific Olympics.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nWilliams was born in Cambridge and brought up in Bath, being educated at Hayesfield School Technology College, Beechen Cliff School and the University of Bath. \n\nHer father, Ian Williams, is a professor of Chemistry at the University of Bath, and her mother, Janet Williams, is a former midwife. Williams has a twin sister and an older brother.\n\nCareer\n\nWilliams was originally a 400m runner but she was unable to qualify for the national athletics team. She began competing in skeleton in 2002 after trying out at a push-start track at the University of Bath. She described her first experience on a skeleton track as exhilarating and terrifying, but she nonetheless enjoyed it and began training in skeleton.\n\nAt her first major event, the 2009 World Championships in Lake Placid, she won a silver medal. \n\nWilliams was unable to qualify for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, as Great Britain was only allowed to enter a single skeleton athlete in that year\'s competition, a spot won by Shelley Rudman, who went on to win the silver medal. Four years later, she qualified for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada, where her country was allowed to send two skeleton athletes. \n\nAt the 2010 Games, Williams won the gold medal in the women\'s skeleton breaking the track record twice along the way and winning by more than a half a second.  At the end of the first day, on which Williams had established a 0.3s advantage over second placed Kerstin Szymkowiak, two protests were filed by other nations over the aerodynamics of Williams\' helmet. The protests claimed that the helmet\'s spoilers were illegal and gave her an unfair aerodynamic advantage. The manufacturer claimed that they were integral to the helmet\'s design. Both protests were rejected by the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation, which had passed the helmet—with ridges—days earlier.    \n\nWilliams became the first British gold medallist in an individual event at the Winter Olympics for 30 years, following Robin Cousins\' victory in figure skating at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, and the first British female individual Winter Olympics gold medallist since Jeannette Altwegg in 1952.\n\nIn June 2011, Williams appeared in an episode of the television show Top Gear in which she raced against a rally Mini Cooper at Lillehammer, Norway. Williams was 1.31 seconds slower in her skeleton run down the two kilometre Olympic track (1m 01.04s) than the car (59.73s) (which covered the same distance on a road that interweaves the circuit). \n\nWilliams was a contestant in the second series of the ITV show 71 Degrees North in late 2011.    She finished the series in third place.\n\nShe has also appeared in the CBBC series, 12 again.\n\nPost-retirement\n\nOn 1 May 2012, Williams announced her retirement from skeleton and said her injuries were behind her quitting the sport. \n\nIn January 2013, BBC Two announced Williams as a co-presenter on the 35th series of Ski Sunday. \n\nApproached by motorsports pundit and part-time rally driver Tony Jardine, Williams agreed to co-drive a Honda Civic, with the aim of competing in Rally GB. After gaining her licence, the pair successfully trained and qualified to compete in the 2013 Welsh-based Rally GB. \n\nAs well as taking up a new role as TeamGB Ambassador, with Robin Cousins, she has also taken a commentator role with the BBC Sport commentating team specialising in the ice sports of skeleton and bobsleigh. \n\nOn 25 April 2014, it was announced that Williams would replace Rachel Riley as a presenter on Channel 5\'s The Gadget Show. \n\nIn August 2015, Amy married Craig Ham 18 months after first meeting him via Tinder. The couple tied the knot at St Nicholas\'s Church in Bathampton, the village where Amy was raised.\n\nAwards and honours\n\nWilliams was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours.  She was installed as an Honorary Freeman of the City of Bath on 5 June 2010.\nQuestion:\nAmy Williams and Lizzy Yarnold of Great Britain have won the Winter Olympic Gold Medal at the last two games in which event?\nAnswer:\nSkeleton\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\n""Top Gear"" (2002) - News - IMDb\n""Top Gear"" (2002) - News\nNEWS\ntrailers and videos full cast and crew trivia official sites memorable quotes\nOverview\n""Top Gear"" ( 2002 ) More at IMDbPro \xa0»\nIMDb.com, Inc. takes no responsibility for the content or accuracy of the above news articles, Tweets, or blog posts.
